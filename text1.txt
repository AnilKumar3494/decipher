SYNOPSIS
INTRODUCTION:
In India, pivotal rights ensuring human dignity and integrity encompass the right to privacy and the right to knowledge. These rights are imperative for upholding one's life quality. The right to privacy safeguards personal matters, while the latter empowers citizens to hold governmental bodies accountable for public affairs. The Supreme Court's fluctuating perspective on privacy's inclusion within fundamental rights, namely life and personal liberty, has been inconsistent. Over time, the Indian Supreme Court's decisions have progressively delineated the evolution of the right to privacy. These verdicts constitute a sequence of judgments that underline the growth and maturation of this fundamental right.
The court has recently undertaken the task of delineating the elusive concept of privacy, recognizing it as a spectrum of rights encompassing both public and private domains. The rapid technological progress has reshaped privacy, introducing a novel facet known as informational privacy. In the digital realm, personal data is ubiquitous, dispersed among governmental and non-governmental entities rather than residing solely with individuals. Consequently, the potential hazards arising from the mishandling and abuse of such information cannot be dismissed. Hence, this research article aims to conduct an exhaustive analysis of the vested interests within the right to privacy concerning information, specifically addressing informational privacy.
To comprehensively comprehend the existing protective scope concerning informational privacy, this dissertation will meticulously scrutinize an array of pertinent subjects and associated concerns. Furthermore, an assessment of pertinent legislation relevant to informational privacy will be undertaken. Through these deliberations, a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of privacy rights in the context of information will be achieved.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Data protection encompasses a spectrum of legal frameworks, regulations, and protocols devised to mitigate intrusions on privacy arising from the collection, retention, and dissemination of personal data. Personal data encompasses any information with potential to identify an individual, regardless of its source—be it a government entity, a commercial enterprise, or any other party. While the Indian Constitution doesn't explicitly enshrine the fundamental right to privacy, judicial interpretation has integrated this right within existing essential freedoms like the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a), and the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21. However, it's noteworthy that these Constitutional guarantees are circumscribed by reasonable restrictions as stipulated in Article 19(2), which the State is authorized to impose.
In the recent pivotal case of Justice K S Puttaswamy (Retd.) & Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors.,  the esteemed Supreme Court's constitution bench ruled that the right to privacy is a fundamental entitlement, albeit subject to reasonable limitations. Presently, the Data Protection Bill of 2019, yet to be ratified by a select committee, stands as the solitary explicit legislation safeguarding data protection and privacy in India. However, the Information Technology Act of 2000 and the (Indian) Contract Act of 1872 are the prevailing legal instruments in India addressing data protection. The government has issued the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011.
These rules exclusively pertain to the safeguarding of "Sensitive Personal Data or Information of a Person," encompassing details like passwords, financial particulars such as bank account and payment instrument data, physical and mental health conditions, sexual orientation, medical histories, and biometric data. The regulations delineate prescribed security standards and protocols applicable when handling such "Personal Sensitive Data or Information," whether by a corporate entity or its representatives, in processes encompassing data collection, reception, possession, storage, handling, or management. In instances of data breaches, the corporate entity or its agents may be held liable for compensating the affected individual . 
Deliberate and unauthorized disclosure of information, undertaken without consent and in contravention of a valid agreement, is subject to penalties under section 72A of the (Indian) Information Technology Act, 2000. This offense carries a potential sentence of up to three years' imprisonment and a fine of Rs 5,00,000. It's pertinent to highlight that Section 69 of the Act carves out an exception from the general principle of maintaining information privacy and confidentiality. This section empowers the government, upon satisfaction of its necessity in the context of India's sovereignty, integrity, defense, state security, foreign relations, public order, or the prevention of incitement to cognizable offenses related to these concerns, to intercept, monitor, or decrypt any information, including sensitive personal data, residing on computer resources.
In India, safeguarding individuals' dignity and integrity hinges on two pivotal rights: the right to privacy and the right to knowledge. These rights are vital for upholding quality of life. While privacy empowers individuals to shield personal matters, the right to knowledge empowers citizens to hold government bodies accountable for significant public affairs. Often, these rights harmonize to render the government accountable to the populace. Yet, when seeking access to private data retained by governmental entities, a conflict between these rights arises. Globally, the connection between the right to privacy and right to information laws is a significant and contentious topic due to varying legislative approaches in different countries .
Within India, the absence of a comprehensive legal framework has precipitated considerable opposition and controversy surrounding data protection laws. The surge in online crimes worldwide, encompassing data theft and its illicit trade across geographical boundaries, underscores the pressing need for robust cybersecurity measures. As the largest hub of outsourced data processing, India confronts the potential of becoming a hotspot for cybercrimes, exacerbated by the current legal void in this area. The Data Security Council of India (DSCI) and the Department of Information Technology (DIT) must invigorate their efforts in tandem with effective legal provisions, public awareness, and workforce education, constituting a multifaceted approach to address this urgent concern.
The present circumstances mandate a profound shift in India's cyber defense infrastructure. Prioritizing data security is paramount, necessitating a holistic re-evaluation of existing practices. Revitalizing legal structures and fostering a culture of vigilance are imperative to counter the escalating threats posed by the digital landscape. The exigency for comprehensive cyber security reforms cannot be understated, warranting immediate attention and concerted efforts.
The breach of even the Prime Minister's Office's (PMO) cyber security over an extended period compels us to face reality. Mere reclassification, akin to designating a domestic cat as a tiger, falls short in addressing the mounting data breaches and cybercrimes in India. Effective cyber laws must be buttressed by robust cyber security measures and efficient cyber forensics for tangible success. India's IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) sectors handle a plethora of sensitive global data, encompassing credit card details, financial records, and medical histories. Stored in electronic formats, this information is susceptible to compromise, particularly when accessible by employees, some of whom may have malicious intent .
Instances of security lapses and data leaks within prominent Indian firms have underscored concerns surrounding data privacy, particularly magnified by recent data thefts in the BPO sector. Notably, India lacks dedicated legislation for safeguarding personal data, despite the introduction of the Personal Data Protection Bill to the legislature in 2006—a bill that remains unenacted. To effectively counter these mounting challenges, the synergy between comprehensive legal provisions, stringent cyber security protocols, and swift legislative action is imperative. The breach of the highest echelons of authority's cyber defenses serves as a stark reminder that holistic and immediate efforts are requisite to fortify India's digital landscape against the rising tide of cyber threats . 
The measure appears to continue on the broad framework of the Data Privacy Directive of the European Union, which was passed in 1996. The law, which follows a complete model, aims to oversee the acquisition, processing, and dissemination of personal data. It does so by following this approach. It is essential to keep in mind that the scope of the law's applicability is restricted to "personal data" as specified in Clause 2 of the bill. The bill applies to both public and commercial organizations that perform data-related services. the government is included in this category. There is a provision in the law that allows for the appointment of individuals known as Data Controllers. These individuals have general supervisory and adjudicatory authority over the many topics that are addressed in the bill. 
Furthermore, it establishes the potential for legal retribution against perpetrators and mandates compensatory measures for victims. This is undeniably a constructive stride. However, despite its merit, the proposition remains pending due to a dearth of comprehensive information. Notably, the Information Technology Act of 2000 (IT Act) encompasses provisions addressing cyber and related IT laws, outlining the extent of permissible access to stored data within computers, computer systems, or networks. Yet, these provisions fall short of addressing the critical necessity for a robust data protection framework. The IT Act, originally enacted in 2000, underwent recent revision to counter evolving cyber threats, albeit its enforcement awaits implementation. This revision introduced two pivotal clauses, Section 43A and Section 72A, amplifying the legal contours governing data protection.
Regrettably, the prevailing regulations concerning data security and confidentiality remain inadequate. Recent instances of data breaches within the BPO sector have ignited apprehensions about data privacy . A case in point is an employee who illicitly sold personal data of numerous British citizens to an undercover journalist from The Sun, a British newspaper. This incident has spurred discussions within offshore industry circles, media forums, and legal spheres, probing the security of foreign data when entrusted to Indian custodians. As India grapples with burgeoning data-centric challenges, enacting comprehensive data protection legislation assumes paramount significance, serving as an essential deterrent against breaches and fortifying trust in the digital landscape . 
The recent amendments seem to arise as a reactionary measure by the Government, catalyzed by recent data breaches and related incidents. India faces not only challenges pertaining to data protection but also more immediate concerns linked to cybercrime and e-commerce transactions. The clauses introduced ostensibly for data protection purposes appear as a piecemeal augmentation to the existing IT Act, falling short of providing comprehensive safeguarding for individuals' personal data within the Indian context. In light of these circumstances, a pertinent question arises: Given India's substantial position in the global IT landscape, can it afford to address such a critical issue in the manner presented by the amendments to the IT Act?
The trajectory of the Supreme Court's stance on recognizing the right to privacy within the ambit of the basic rights to life and personal liberty has not been consistently steadfast. A series of judgments from the Indian Supreme Court throughout history offers insights into the past and guides the future course of the right to privacy in the nation. Recent judicial endeavors have sought to elucidate the elusive concept of privacy, acknowledging it as a constellation of rights relevant both in personal and public domains. This endeavor seeks to crystallize a notion of privacy that has often been termed "fragile." The evolution of technology has transformed privacy dynamics, introducing a novel facet known as informational privacy. In today's interconnected realm, fragments of information about each individual populate the digital sphere. This data varies in form and substance, existing beyond individual ownership and instead being held by state or non-state entities. This shift accentuates the inherent risks and potential abuses of information. Hence, this study undertakes an exhaustive examination of the layers of interests interwoven with the right to privacy concerning information, thereby accommodating informational privacy. The article further scrutinizes a gamut of challenges and intricacies tethered to informational privacy. Subsequently, an exploration of pertinent legal statutes associated with informational privacy ensues, aiming to fathom the extant scope of protection accorded to this facet of privacy .
The idea of privacy has existed since the beginning of human society. The concept of privacy is hard to understand, though. For certain scholars, the term "privacy" has varied connotations, and those meanings change as society changes. Examining debates about privacy and secrecy in the Constituent Assembly will allow you to learn more about its history. The discussions in the Constituent Assembly make it very evident that the Right to Privacy was purposely left out of the Constitution. The reasons why lawmakers took this action are still a mystery. 
Despite not being explicitly enshrined in the Indian Constitution, the Right to Privacy has evolved through judicial rulings post-independence. Its initial acknowledgment occurred in the Kharak Singh case. Numerous statutes like the Indian Evidence Act, Information Technology Act, Indian Penal Code, Criminal Law, Indian Telegraph Act, Indian Easement Act, and Family Law contain clauses pertaining to privacy, reflecting the multifaceted legal landscape on this matter. 
We've gone into great detail about these Laws in this post. The privacy of one's physical space, biological identification and information, and personal preferences are only a few of the various varieties of privacy that have emerged over time. And in the current digital era that we live in, it is even more crucial to protect this right. In the current digital era, there has been some debate over how social media affects privacy rights. In order to determine whether the laws in place to protect people's privacy go far enough to handle issues like invasions of privacy, which are protected by Article 21[2], we will carefully examine those laws.
1.1 Techno-legal Issues in e-Commerce - Definitional Analysis
In e-commerce, diverse techno-legal challenges significantly affect individuals' privacy and data. Within this landscape, six distinct issues of techno-legal nature warrant discussion, as outlined in the subsequent sections: 
(i)	Data Mining (legal and ethical privacy concerns)
(ii)	Cookies (Cookies' role in Click Stream Data, P3P, RFID, and tracking consumer activities)
(iii)	Security Threats (Logic bombs, computer infections, hacking, and web bugs)
(iv)	International Data Transfer (Issues surrounding cross-border data transmission)
(v)	Social Networking Concerns (Challenges in platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, e-media, press, and email)
(vi)	Terminology (Understanding terms such as data, databases, sensitive personal data, traffic data, etc., as defined in sections 43A and 72A of the 2008 Information Technology (Amended) Act).
Data Mining is the process of extracting valuable insights from databases by transforming raw data into useful information. The escalating storage capacities facilitated by advancements in software and hardware have led to the accumulation of vast data by government bodies, scientific institutions, and corporations. Safeguarding these repositories from corruption, hijacking, and manipulation poses challenges, necessitating robust data protection measures. Similarly, the secure extraction of data in the event of such threats becomes imperative. The subsequent protection of this extracted data against intrusion, theft, manipulation, or misuse presents an intricate task, further compounded by evolving privacy laws and ethical considerations .
To effectively navigate the techno-legal complexities of privacy and data protection in e-commerce, familiarity with key terms is essential. Concepts like data, database, sensitive personal data, traffic data, data theft, identity theft, click stream data, data controller, phishing, spam, cloud computing, blogging, whistle-blowing, encryption, adware, spyware, and browsing hold pivotal importance in comprehending these issues. Such terminology sheds light on the intricate landscape of data security in the digital realm . 
i. Data: Similar to the cyber convention, the I.T. Act of 2008 attempts to define the term "data" as a collection of "knowledge," "information," and "facts." Other important sections of this statute include Section 2(1)(t). The I.T. (Amendment) Act of 2009 introduced a much-needed amendment for the preservation of privacy in matters of personal data in the form of Section 43 A, which makes 2009 a progressive year. And obtaining legal recognition and making the intruder liable in the form of Compensation for failing to protect data was a further successful step.
ii. Databases: Traditionally, a database is perceived as a unified entity encompassing computer programs, tables, aggregates, and computer databases. However, the Information Technology Act necessitates distinct recognition and treatment of databases concerning the scope of copyright protection.
iii. Sensitive Personal Data: This stands as a pivotal matter demanding attention. Such data is under the ownership of individuals harboring sensitive details concerning their private lives or inherently personal information.
iv. Traffic Data: Section 69B of the Information Technology Act, 2008 furnishes precise definitions of the term "traffic data" within its explanatory framework. Due to their association with individuals and their substantial worth, this category of information garners heightened importance according to the Act's provisions. The Convention on Cyber Crime explicitly defines 'Traffic Data' as electronically stored information predominantly coursing through computer systems and encompassing communications that yield data or computer data. This encompasses data generation facilitated by networks or computer programs and systems, inclusive of packet headers, pen register data, and trap and trace data generated by these programs, systems, or networks.
v. click-stream data: Click-stream data refers to the information stored by collecting agents regarding cookies as they transmit requests to their servers. Cookies, identifiers for individual computers, play a role in accumulating extensive click-stream data. The State holds the responsibility for defining and safeguarding data and privacy, as data protection not only preserves personal privacy but also individual autonomy. Notably, the seminal judgments in the MP Sharma and Kharak Singh cases omitted to explicitly define and incorporate privacy into the Fundamental Rights section of the Indian Constitution. Presently, the 'right to privacy' has garnered momentum and stands as a contented constitutional bench. The landmark Puttaswamy case has pivotal implications, cementing the right to privacy as a fundamental entitlement. This judgment underscores the imperative for a comprehensive data protection legislation and accentuates the significance of principles like informed consent and informational privacy in an era dominated by the "big brother" trend. 
vi. Data theft: Data theft pertains to the illicit replication or extraction of confidential information from businesses. The Information Technology (Amended) Act of 2008, specifically Section 43(b) coupled with Section 66, encompasses offenses related to "Data Theft." Identity theft has resulted in substantial financial losses, often occurring without victims' awareness. Intriguingly, the concept of theft, even extending to movable property, is exemplified by Anthony Lemar Taylor, an individual experienced in petty larceny and first-degree robberies. This phenomenon transcends realms, as even the illustrious golfer Tiger Woods fell victim to identity theft, emphasizing its pervasive impact and its violation of one's persona.
vii. Identity theft: It is defined as "the fraudulent use of another person's identity, typically for financial gain" and affects approximately 7,000,000 Americans annually. America is one of the most important centers for Data extraction. Steve Smith, basketball player Will Smith, etc. 
viii Data processor: In the discourse on data, the terms 'data processor' and 'employer of the data controller' hold significance. The data controller, in this context, oversees data processing on the data owner's behalf. The role of a data controller involves determining the procedures, encompassing purpose and methodology, for executing the specified task. It is crucial to discern that while the data controller accesses and processes the data belonging to the data owner, they lack control over the data and, consequently, bear no liability. Devices like calculators and computers exemplify data processors, executing data processing tasks. Notably, cloud service providers are pertinent additions to the roster of data processors.
ix Phishing: Phishing denotes the fraudulent acquisition of sensitive information, perpetuated through the deceptive use of technology. Amid technological strides, an array of cybercrimes, including cyber-squatting, cyber abuse, and hacking, has emerged, inflicting economic and personal repercussions on e-users. 'Internet Phishing,' a prominent cybercrime, involves the creation of counterfeit websites to deceive users into disclosing personal data, exploiting the façade of authenticity or security through electronic communication with seemingly legitimate platforms. In the wake of social networking sites, accompanied by the absence of security cues, techniques like visual deception text, obscured images, overlapping windows, and inadequate user guidelines have bolstered phishers' capacity to access personal data. Phishers exploit online payment services to acquire sensitive consumer information, imperiling both economic and personal interests of Internet users. Vigilant oversight is imperative to mitigate the perils of Internet phishing and uphold end users' security. 
x Spam: Data breaches, the unauthorized access or release of confidential information, raise pressing concerns in modern society. Such breaches encompass the intrusion into personal, financial, or sensitive data, resulting in potential harm to individuals. These breaches often occur due to inadequate cybersecurity measures, leading to data leakage and identity theft. In legal terms, data breaches may trigger regulatory penalties and civil liabilities. Organizations handling personal data have a legal obligation to safeguard it and promptly report breaches to relevant authorities. To address this escalating issue, many jurisdictions have introduced data protection laws mandating stringent cybersecurity practices, breach notification procedures, and punitive measures against non-compliance. Preventive strategies such as encryption, regular security audits, and employee training are integral in maintaining data integrity and upholding individuals' privacy rights. 
xi. Cloud Computing: Cloud computing, a dynamic paradigm in Information Technology, facilitates ubiquitous access to data and resources stored remotely on internet-connected servers. This innovation offers users the convenience of storing, managing, and processing data on a scalable and distributed infrastructure. Cloud services encompass Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), each tailored to diverse user requirements. However, this transformative model introduces intricate legal considerations. Issues regarding data security, privacy, data ownership, jurisdiction, and compliance arise due to the cross-border nature of cloud services. Service level agreements, data protection regulations, and contractual frameworks play pivotal roles in delineating responsibilities and ensuring legal conformity. As cloud computing continues to shape our technological landscape, comprehensive legal frameworks are essential to safeguarding individuals' rights and fostering responsible utilization of this transformative technology.
xii. Blog: A 'blog,' short for 'weblog,' serves as an online platform within the World Wide Web, allowing users to share informal opinions, content, and experiences at their discretion. Typically hosted by a Blog Service Provider, these platforms offer space for content dissemination and may include advertisements. Bloggers can articulate their viewpoints, personal insights, knowledge, and news on diverse subjects, though certain topics might be restricted. This digital forum supersedes traditional diary-writing, offering an inclusive space for individuals to share their perspectives openly. Synonyms like 'tumbler' and 'WordPress' signify similar platforms, which provide a channel for self-expression and content creation. It's noteworthy that 'blogger' and 'blogging' are interconnected yet distinct terms. While the former pertains to crafting blog content, the latter encapsulates the broader act of expressing thoughts and opinions on a range of subjects. 
xiii. Whistleblowers: These are individuals who reveal or disclose information on topics and issues such as willful corruption abuse or any other information that is commonly labeled as illegal disclosure. Some individuals deemed these revelations unethical and undesirable. There have been instances in which whistleblowers have been assaulted in public and in private, and some have died as a result. To stop this threat, it is necessary to conceal their identity and keep it secure. In order to safeguard the lives and identities of whistleblowers, journalists, and activists, websites such as Wiki leak acquire and publish sensitive information.
xiv 'Encryption' provides protection against unauthorized access. It encodes information so that only authorized individuals will have access. Adware and Spyware: The terms Adware and Spyware are frequently used interchangeably, and there is little distinction between the two. Adware typically includes an uninstaller and is simple to eliminate from a computer system. Spyware is software that facilitates the collection of information about individuals and entities without their consent and knowledge. Frequently, such software controls the information of e-consumers and transmits it to third parties without the data owner's consent. Cookies are the most prevalent instance. 
xv Browsing: In the digital era, facilitated by the internet and the World Wide Web, the ease of accessing diverse information through a mere mouse click and communicating across global jurisdictions is unparalleled. Primarily, the term 'peruse' encapsulates the act of searching, often synonymous with browsing. Amid this expansive information exchange, the risk of security breaches escalates, stemming from unauthorized access. Security breaches ensue when private and confidential data is illicitly exploited by unauthorized entities or individuals, traversing boundaries and jurisdictions, posing significant threats to data integrity and privacy.
1.2 Definition of Privacy Rights
The concept of "Privacy" proves intricate when subjected to definition, spawning various interpretations. "Right to Privacy," as defined in Black's Law Dictionary, encompasses a spectrum of rights intrinsic to the concept of ordered liberty. These rights preserve an individual's fundamental prerogative to determine their interactions with family, others, and societal engagements, enveloping personal relationships and activities. Privacy, in essence, safeguards an individual's legitimate autonomy to select the extent of self-disclosure and exercise authority over the manner, timing, and context of such disclosures. It encompasses the unbounded agency to choose participation or abstention according to individual discretion, while also entrusting individuals with control over the dissemination of their own information, of which they are the sole proprietors. Meanwhile, the notion of "Right to be left alone" underscores an individual's entitlement to privacy .
The encompassing term "Right to Privacy" subsumes a multitude of rights acknowledged within the precinct of ordered liberty. Integral to this right are both the freedoms of assembly and speech, which empower individuals to engage in collective interactions and articulate their thoughts freely. In the intricate landscape of modern communication, privacy serves as an essential buffer, allowing individuals to determine their boundaries and navigate interpersonal and societal dynamics on their terms, fostering a harmonious coexistence of personal autonomy and societal engagement.
 
CHAPTER 2: EVOLUTION OF RIGHT TO PRIVACY
Privacy emerges as a natural extension of the concept of an individual as a natural person. Despite being an integral part of society, an individual upholds the notion that certain facets of their life merit complete non-interference, both from fellow individuals and the state to which they belong. Privacy assumes multifarious forms, encompassing the protection of private property, the proprietary aspect of privacy, the safeguarding of one's name and image, confidentiality in personal affairs, the internal matters of voluntary associations and business corporations, and the privacy surrounding matters of a sexual and familial nature. While the interpretation of the Right to Privacy may fluctuate based on perspective and context, its core essence can be distilled into the simple right to be left undisturbed. Professor Alan F. Westin articulates privacy as "the right of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine when, how, and to what extent information about them is shared with others."
Though only a few years have transpired since the landmark pronouncement by a nine-judge majority of the Indian Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice J. S. Khehar, deeming the Right to Privacy a fundamental right for Indian citizens under the Constitution, the impact has been profound. The deliberation surrounding this right has been a persistent discourse in India for decades. As a nation historically characterized by a collective and communal ethos, emphasizing cooperation and community over competition and isolation, questions have arisen regarding the alignment of privacy with Indian cultural values. Yet, it's imperative to dispel the notion that privacy is at odds with Indian culture, as privacy's significance and recognition as a fundamental right underscore its universal and enduring relevance in the evolving socio-legal landscape .
The roots of the concept of privacy  can be traced back to ancient Hindu texts such as the Hitopadesha and the Dharmashastras. In ancient India, the Dharmasastras and their commentaries meticulously elucidated the privacy laws governing the Indian subcontinent. Monarchs were held accountable to uphold Dharma and respect the privacy of citizens. These texts advocate that certain subjects, including religion, sexuality, and family matters, should be kept confidential. The ancient Indian adage "Sarvas Swe Swe Grihe Raja" (everyone is a monarch in their own home) reinforces the value of personal privacy. Though limited studies exist on the privacy norms of ancient Indian society, an intricate examination of interpersonal obligations and overall way of life reveals a profound regard for personal privacy, anchored in exceptional rules.
The ancient Indian traditions documented in the Upanishads, Vedic culture, Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Manu Smriti underscore privacy as a fundamental aspect of individual existence. Norms safeguarding individuals' seclusion are evident in these scriptures. Kautilya's Arthashastra, written between 321-296 B.C., outlines a detailed procedure to uphold the right to privacy during ministerial consultations. Thus, viewed through a historical lens, privacy emerges as an essential civil liberty that upholds an individual's freedom and dignity. As India's history progresses to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the notion of privacy evolves to include the sanctity of private property. Documents like the Constitution of India Bill 1895 and the Commonwealth of India Bill 1925 mark milestones in asserting the inviolability of an individual's dwelling place, emphasizing protection from intrusion without due process. This historical trajectory underscores the enduring significance of privacy in shaping legal and societal perspectives . 
The Nehru Report of 1928 introduced a set of rights akin to those in question. However, when India gained independence and formulated its Constitution, the right to privacy was not explicitly listed among the fundamental rights bestowed upon Indian citizens. Although the issue of the right to privacy was extensively debated in the Constituent Assembly, it did not receive formal endorsement. The formal proceedings of the Constituent Assembly commenced in December 1946 with the initiation of drafting activities. Subsequently, multiple committees were convened within the Constituent Assembly, tasked with presenting reports to the Drafting Committee responsible for framing the Constitution.
During the committee stage, a subgroup advocated for the inclusion of the right to privacy in Fundamental Rights. Eminent members such as K.M. Munshi, Harman Singh, and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar firmly championed the incorporation of the right to privacy within the Fundamental Rights framework. Dr. Ambedkar's draft proposed the concept of "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches." On the other hand, members like B.N. Rau and A.K. Ayyar staunchly opposed elevating the right to privacy to the status of a Fundamental Right . Their reservations stemmed from concerns about potential complications. Ayyar believed that safeguarding privacy and correspondence secrecy could inadvertently equate private civil correspondence with official state documents, potentially disrupting civil litigation. Rau, on the other hand, expressed apprehensions about potential clashes between the right to privacy and police investigative authority. Their reservations were successful in influencing the Advisory Committee, which ultimately excluded provisions related to the right to privacy from its final report. Various attempts during the Constituent Assembly sessions sought to introduce the right to privacy into the chapter on fundamental rights, but these efforts remained contentious and unresolved . 
As one of the members of the Constituent Assembly, Somnath Lahiri, proposed on 30 April 1947 to make the right to privacy of correspondence a fundamental right, 'the privacy of correspondence shall be inviolable and may only be infringed upon in accordance with the provisions of law. However, this proposal did not receive support in the Assembly. Kazi Syed Karimuddin tried again on 3rd December 1948, nearly a year later, to include "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue except upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized." 
Kazi Syed Karimuddin proposed an amendment to the Draft Constitution to include the right to seclusion, citing analogous provisions in other constitutions such as Article 4 of the American Constitution, Clauses (2) and (5) of the Irish Constitution, and Article 114 and 115 of the German Constitution. However, this proposal failed to garner adequate support, leading to the omission of the right to seclusion from the Indian Constitution's list of Fundamental Rights granted to its citizens. Despite this initial omission, the Supreme Court of India has progressively played a pivotal role in addressing cases related to the right to privacy over time.
The Supreme Court's involvement has significantly contributed to elevating the right to privacy to its rightful position as an intrinsic facet of the Right to Life and Liberty enshrined in Article 21  of the Indian Constitution. Through landmark cases and rulings, the court has underscored the importance of safeguarding individual privacy. These judicial interventions have effectively granted constitutional recognition to the Right to Privacy in India, despite its absence in the original enumeration of Fundamental Rights. This evolution signifies the court's commitment to aligning legal principles with the changing socio-technological landscape and ensuring that citizens' privacy is adequately protected.
2.1 International Historical Development of Right To Privacy
Rights come with living life to the fullest. As a result, many rights have come to be understood as the inevitable results of political, social, and economic improvements throughout time. Even if the law had only previously recognized a few rights, such as the right to life and the right to property, it eventually began to recognize human sentiments, emotions, intellects, etc. The term "right to life" has gradually come to refer to both the "right to enjoy life" and the "right to be left alone," often known as "the right to privacy."
Privacy is not a concept that has developed overnight. The debate over privacy issues is said to be as old as humanity itself. The distinction between the private and public worlds was originally made by Aristotle, according to some philosophers . While the Romans developed the idea of privacy and made legal attempts to safeguard it. The idea may also be traced back to a number of antiquated codes, including the Greek, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon ones . In fact, both sociological and anthropological discourses have deep historical origins in the idea of privacy. The formal reference to privacy is frequently recognized as Aristotle's distinction between the public and private domains of politics, or the polis and oikos. A fundamental movement in privacy from the public to private and social spheres, or what is known as the "horizontal approach," is said to be caused by innovation and people's propensity toward individuality. The vertical structure, however, is limited to the idea of the interaction between the State and its citizens.
The idea of privacy was originally intended to safeguard one's physical integrity and house against unauthorized intrusion, but it gradually shifted toward having control over personal information. The right to privacy has a lengthy evolutionary history, but it only became clear in the late 19th century. While the public's interest in privacy has recently increased significantly during the previous century. The Right to Privacy, an academic work by Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren, first introduced the contemporary structure of the idea in 1890.[29] Since then, the idea of "privacy" has grown in popularity, been broadly accepted, and started to be acknowledged as one of the essential human rights.
The key issues as portrayed in Warren and Brandeis' work were the intrusiveness and offensiveness of US media starting in the 1900s. However, the main point of their piece was how serious privacy concerns were raised by technology innovation. The press, instantaneous photography, newspapers, and various mechanical technologies were recognized by Warren and Brandeis as the new dangers to privacy. According to research covering the years 1850–1890, newspaper readership surged by about 1,000%, going from 100 papers with 800,000 readers to 900 papers with more than 8,000,000 readers, illustrating the rising influence of the press and its risks to personal privacy .
One may argue that the idea of privacy as we know it now dates back over 150 years. The development of privacy is best described as follows: Since the 1215 era, silent prayer and reading have been a common practice. Since the 1700 era, single beds have been the norm. Since the 1900s, people have been concerned about the privacy of information, especially after the publication of Warren and Brandeis' "The Right to Privacy." Now, however, privacy is about to end once more, as it did in the early.
It's fascinating that Professor Solove opted to utilize cartoons in TechPrivacy to explain the development of privacy. He uses a number of scientific advancements, such as the 1880s introduction of portable cameras, the 1890s introduction of telephone wiretapping, the 1960s introduction of mainframe computers, the 1980s introduction of personal computers, the 1990s introduction of portable phones, the 2000s introduction of portable computers, the 2010s introduction of smartphones, and the 2070s introduction of holographic life projection, to show how the death of privacy has already begun and will continue.
It could be useful to mention that Westin divided the development of modern privacy into four phases: the first phase, from 1945 to 1960; the second phase, from 1961 to 1979; the third phase, from 1980 to 1989; and the fourth phase, from 1990 to 2002. According to Westin, the fifth phase, which spans from 2003 to the present, may be characterized as the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), ubiquitous computing, social media, Google, and WikiLeaks . During this time, the usage of personal data has expanded to an unprecedented degree, creating significant threats to information privacy. Despite the fact that there are allusions to privacy in many academic disciplines and even in ancient literature, formal legal debate on the subject only began and became well known following Warren and Brandeis's seminal book, "The Right to Privacy," as shown by a number of scholarly papers .
 
CHAPTER 3: RIGHT TO PRIVACY: INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE 
Differing from national and regional legal frameworks, the recognition of privacy was first encapsulated in Article 12 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). However, this acknowledgment of privacy is not confined solely to the UDHR. Other international agreements also contain scattered privacy provisions, which can be categorized into two main groups: (1) United Nations (UN) agreements and (2) Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) agreements.
Within these international agreements, there are distinct clauses aimed at safeguarding privacy rights. Notable agreements encompassing such clauses include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) of 1948, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) of 1966, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) of 1989, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (1990), and the UN General Assembly Guidelines Concerning Computerized Personal Data Files (1990). The European Convention on Human Rights is yet another international instrument that contributes to the protection of privacy on a broader scale . These agreements collectively underscore the international community's recognition of privacy as a fundamental human right, reflecting the growing global importance of safeguarding individual privacy in an interconnected world.
3.1 The International Agreements
The UDHR, 1948:
The recognition of the right to privacy extends beyond the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) to encompass numerous international, regional, and national legal and human rights frameworks. Remarkably, it was the UDHR that marked the initiation of privacy's acknowledgment within United Nations documents. This trajectory indicates that the 'right to privacy' was established as an international human right prior to its formal enshrinement within constitutions.
In particular, Article 12 of the UDHR explicitly enunciates the principle of privacy protection, asserting that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home, or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation." This pivotal article establishes privacy as an intrinsic human right, obligating states to afford legal safeguards against unwarranted intrusions and derogatory actions. Consequently, the UDHR's role in shaping the concept of privacy as a universally acknowledged human right is undeniable.
The ICCPR, 1966: 
The acknowledgment of privacy found its place in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), adopted 18 years after the UDHR. Notably, this article closely mirrors the language of Article 12 of the UDHR. However, the subtle distinction arises with the insertion of the term "unlawful" twice before "interference" and "attacks" in Article 17 of the ICCPR. This nuance sets the two articles apart.
For instance, Article 17 of the ICCPR explicitly asserts, "No one should be the subject of arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home, or communication, nor of unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation." This amendment highlights the imperative of not only protecting privacy but ensuring that such safeguards are rooted in legality. This subtle addition reinforces the principle that privacy should be shielded from any form of intrusion or violation that contravenes established legal norms, underscoring the significance of legal protection in upholding privacy rights .
The CRC, 1989:
An additional noteworthy UN instrument, the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), holds the protection of children's private interests among its objectives. Enacted by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) through Resolution 44/25 on November 20, 1989, the CRC commits to upholding the comprehensive rights of children, including their right to privacy. This convention's privacy provisions bear semblance to the principles enshrined in Article 12 of the UDHR and Article 17 of the ICCPR.
For instance, CRC's Article 16 firmly declares , "No child shall be the subject of arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor of unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation." This clause underscores the necessity for legal protection to shield children from unwarranted intrusion or violation of their privacy. The CRC emphasizes the imperative of safeguarding young individuals from any such encroachments or affronts, underscoring the role of legal safeguards in maintaining children's privacy rights.
3.1.1 The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 1990: 
Following suit, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 1990, emerges as another notable UN proposition. This Convention aims to uphold a plethora of rights for migrant workers and their family members, including privacy protection. The language employed in this document echoes the language used in the UDHR, ICCPR, and CRC, underscoring the international consensus on privacy preservation .
Articulated in Article 14 of the Convention, it firmly asserts, "No migrant worker or member of his or her family shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home, correspondence or other communications, or unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation." This provision underscores the commitment to ensure legal safeguards against unwarranted intrusion or violations for every migrant worker and their accompanying family members. The Convention substantiates the principle that privacy is a fundamental right for individuals regardless of their migrant status, emphasizing the significance of protection against undue interference and harm.
3.1.2 The Guidelines for the Regulation of Computerized Personal Data Files, 1990: 
The United Nations (UN) demonstrated a vigilant stance towards safeguarding personal data, in addition to upholding the right to privacy. This stance is exemplified by the "Guidelines for the Regulation of Computerized Personal Data Files," established by the UN General Assembly through Resolution 45/95 on December 14, 1990. It is noteworthy that the fundamental principles of data protection embedded in these Guidelines draw heavily from the Council of Europe's Convention 108 of 1981 and the OECD Privacy Guidelines of 1980 .
These principles include the tenets of (1) lawfulness and fairness, (2) accuracy, (3) purpose specification, (4) access for the concerned individual, (5) non-discrimination, (6) discretion to make exceptions, (7) security measures, (8) oversight and penalties, (9) regulation of cross-border data transfers, and (10) the scope of application. For more comprehensive insights into these concepts, refer to the "Guidelines for the Regulation of Computerized Personal Data Files," as adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 14, 1990. This proactive approach by the UN signifies a concerted effort to establish a global framework that respects individuals' privacy rights while addressing the complex challenges posed by the digital age.
3.2 The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy:
The UN's commitment and initiatives to safeguard privacy have been effectively underscored through the reports of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy. Appointed by the UN Human Rights Council in July 2015, Professor Joseph A. Cannataci became the inaugural Special Rapporteur on "The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age." This role entailed multifaceted responsibilities, encompassing data collection, identification of potential obstacles, engagement in international advocacy, awareness-raising endeavors, and the submission of annual reports to the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council. Professor Cannataci has ardently undertaken his mandate and undertaken several endeavors to champion privacy rights .
Over the years, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy has authored a series of 11 annual reports, addressing various dimensions of privacy protection. These reports have covered topics such as the state of privacy in early 2016, pivotal spheres for safeguarding privacy in the digital era, domestic and global governmental surveillance activities, big data and open data, security and surveillance, as well as the intricate intersection of privacy, technology, and related concerns. The series of annual reports initiated in 2016 has provided comprehensive insights into the evolving landscape of privacy, taking into account technological advancements, legal considerations, and human rights imperatives in the digital age.
3.2.1 Reports of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy
•	More than in previous years, privacy has come to dominate international political, legal, and personal discourse.
•	The courts, particularly in the US and Europe, have made clear attempts to favor privacy, despite the fact that certain governments and their parliaments exhibit unfavorable attitudes toward it.
•	Privacy has been reduced to a commodity, at least according to certain significant suppliers that use it as a selling feature. This tendency compels manufacturers to create technology that respect privacy.
•	Governments from all around the globe should participate in discussions on the proper responsibilities of States and governance structures for certain extremely important issues, such as surveillance, cyberspace, privacy, freedom of expression, and other civil rights.
•	Under article 17 of the ICCPR and other international human rights laws, privacy invasions must be evaluated on their merits. There are a number of interferences that can have both short- and long-term deterrent impacts on freedom of speech, including excessive requests for user data and the keeping of such data by third parties. Additionally, States must ensure that surveillance is carried out by a competent, impartial, and independent judicial authority that can demonstrate that it is necessary and appropriate given the stated objectives.
•	The merger of state practices and corporate functions in the digital age seems to many states to be rather novel. On all digital platforms, there should be ways to strike a balance between the interests of corporations and individual human rights, at both the national and international levels.
•	Like money or labor, data is and will continue to be a key economic resource. The overall reliance on personal data necessitates compliance with privacy and data protection laws.
•	The techniques and procedures used in relation to open data are often supported by economic and political players. However, modern business structures in capitalist economies offer few incentives for the preservation of personal data because there is no associated financial loss.
•	The laws governing data privacy and consumers work best together. The mere reliance on consumer law in the absence of data protection law serves to disprove the link between fundamental human rights and the remedies for their infringement.
•	In order to align with international human rights obligations, the legislations within the Member States necessitate meticulous modifications. This process entails an integration of optimal practices and ethical foundations. Furthermore, the creation of these legal frameworks should adhere to data protection principles and fitting regulatory frameworks. Adequate resources, an impartial overseeing authority, and precise definitions, encompassing data-sharing, utilization, disclosure, and transparency principles, are integral components imperative for this endeavor.
•	Every individual and group in society is urged by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to protect and respect these rights. States, enterprises, civic society, professional associations, religious institutions, and private citizens all have important responsibilities to play in this.
•	Democracy and other principles depend on people feeling comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. As a result, losing one's privacy is comparable to losing faith in the government and other public institutions and ceasing to participate. Eventually, the loss of privacy has a negative impact on and degrades representative democracies.
•	It is imperative to protect the privacy of women, kids, people of all sexual orientations, and those who identify as women or males. A systemic rejection of human rights is the violation of privacy based on gender in particular. It is prejudiced and is persistent in socioeconomic, political, and cultural contexts. As a result, national, regional, and global legal and regulatory frameworks are needed to address this invasion of privacy. When creating and putting into place privacy protection measures, gender should be one of the primary factors taken into account.
•	It is recommended that each Member State undertake the ratification of the updated Modernized Convention 108 along with its Protocol CETS 223. Subsequent to ratification, the prompt integration of these provisions into domestic legal frameworks is advised. This approach ensures a basic yet essential step towards a comprehensive and harmonized global privacy strategy. Additionally, even for Member States not affiliated with the EU, the robust safeguards enshrined in the GDPR may be considered for adoption. In the context of safeguarding personal data on digital platforms, nations lacking robust data protection laws or non-EU affiliations are advised to establish regulations that either meet or exceed the standards set forth by the GDPR.
3.3 The Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles, 2018:
Another significant stride in upholding privacy and safeguarding personal data was taken by the UN through the introduction of the "Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles" in 2018 . This initiative underscores the UN's resolute commitment to preserving privacy rights and ensuring the secure handling of personal information. Adopted during the 36th Meeting of the UN High-Level Committee on Management (HLCM) on October 11, 2018, these principles stand as a foundational framework governing the processing of personal data by UN entities in the course of their routine activities .
The objectives underpinning these principles encompass several key aspects. Firstly, they seek to establish a cohesive standard for safeguarding personal data across various UN organizations. Secondly, the principles aim to facilitate responsible data processing in alignment with the mandates of UN entities. Lastly, a crucial goal is to uphold human rights, fundamental freedoms, and particularly the right to privacy, thus ensuring that data processing is carried out ethically and respectfully. It is noteworthy that these principles mandate that all forms of personal data processing, irrespective of their nature, must adhere to the guiding principles outlined in the document. The complete text of these principles can be accessed in the publication "Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles" available on the CEB: UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination website..
3.3.1 The Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, 1980 (OECD Privacy Guidelines):
Anticipating the rise of transnational data processing activities and the subsequent challenges in ensuring data security under the jurisdiction of individual nations, the 1970s brought about a pressing need for the establishment of universally accepted principles, norms, or guidelines. This practical exigency prompted the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Council of Europe (CoE) to embark on the development of fundamental tenets for safeguarding privacy and harmonizing data protection standards across borders.
As a result of their collaborative efforts, the OECD Council officially endorsed the "Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data" on September 23, 1980. These guidelines sought to address critical objectives, including fostering enhanced cooperation among member states in safeguarding personal data, preventing undue encroachment on the privacy of individuals in the context of cross-border data flows, and establishing baseline standards for the protection of privacy, individual freedoms, and personal data across member nations. Moreover, these guidelines aimed to minimize disparities among member nations with respect to their national laws and practices concerning privacy and data protection. By achieving these objectives, the OECD and the CoE aimed to establish a cohesive global framework for upholding the rights of individuals and ensuring the responsible handling of personal data in the era of increasing transnational data processing operations.
The OECD Privacy Guidelines, as the first transatlantic agreement addressing data privacy, harmonized national legal frameworks with global norms on data transfers. While lacking binding jurisdiction, these Guidelines played a pivotal role in promoting consensus on appropriate data protection standards among its Member Nations. Their significance lies in laying the groundwork for contemporary data protection principles, establishing a crucial link between national and international data privacy regulations. For example, the OECD Privacy Principles, introduced in 1980, along with the Council of Europe's Convention 108, marked the inception of the first generation of global data protection norms. In contrast, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) represents the third generation, succeeding the second-generation standards embodied by Directive 95/46/EC .
The enduring impact of the OECD Privacy Guidelines on global data privacy regulations is undeniable. Despite their voluntary nature, key principles subsequently influenced legislative frameworks. An essential facet of the Guidelines was their application to both public and private sector personal data. Part Two of these guidelines enshrined eight fundamental data privacy principles, serving as the bedrock for tenets in Directive 95/46/EC and the EU's 2018 GDPR. These principles include the collection limitation principle, data quality principle, purpose specification principle, use limitation principle, security safeguards principle, openness principle, individual participation principle, and accountability principle. These principles have reverberated through data privacy standards, shaping the course of modern data protection policies .
3.3.2 The Revised OECD Privacy Framework, 2013:
The OECD Privacy Guidelines 1980, the first worldwide initiative for the fundamental data protection laws, had a significant impact for decades. The chair of the OECD specialized team, Justice M. Kirby, stated that "the continual acceptance of the OECD for a long period of 30 years have proved the utility of the Guidelines, and it was also anticipated."[63] Despite the enormous success, a consensus to update the Guidelines was emerging. The Guidelines have to be updated because of the development of the Internet, the World Wide Web, search engines, social networking sites, location tracking technology, biometrics, and other technologies, etc., which inevitably generated concerns about the Guidelines' efficacy. On September 9, 2013, the OECD finally approved the Revised Guidelines following a thorough assessment process. The unique tactics listed below are provided under the Revised Guidelines:
•	National privacy strategies: While having sufficient regulations is essential, today's strategic relevance of privacy necessitates a multi-pronged national strategy in conjunction with the highest level of government.
•	Programs for managing privacy: The primary operational instrument used by corporations to enforce privacy protection is this mechanism.
•	Notification of a data security breach: This clause calls for notifying both the relevant authorities and the people whose personal data was compromised.
Above all, the Revised OECD Guidelines , 2013 take a transborder data flow approach and outline the essential components that give it the appearance of being a more responsible organization capable of strengthening privacy enforcement. The 'fundamental concepts' of the Guidelines' original edition are not altered in this new version, which represents a shift toward a continuous process. See OECD, OECD Privacy Framework, 2013, for additional information.
3.4 Privacy in the Regional Instruments
Regional legal and human rights instruments encompassing privacy safeguards can be categorized into two distinct sub-groups: non-EU instruments and EU instruments. While the former generally lack the authority to impose obligations upon Member States, the latter often possess the capacity to bind their respective Member Nations. Notably, the EU instruments extend their influence beyond the EU's borders, significantly influencing non-EU countries and prompting alterations in the data protection legislations of both Member States and non-EU nations .
3.4.1 The Non-EU Instruments
Key non-EU legal and human rights instruments, encompassing privacy provisions, comprise the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (1948), the American Convention on Human Rights (1969), the APEC Privacy Framework (2004), its updated version (2015), the Madrid Resolution (2009), the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration (2012), and the ASEAN Framework on Personal Data Protection (2016). These instruments collectively contribute to shaping the landscape of global privacy safeguards.
3.4.2 American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, 1948:
Established in 1948 through the signing of the OAS Charter in Bogotá, Colombia, the Organization of American States (OAS) was shaped by its goal of fostering regional unity and cooperation among Member Nations. A significant milestone was the approval of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man by the OAS on May 2, 1948, a foundational document that encompassed clauses dedicated to safeguarding privacy.
Article V of the OAS Charter stands as a testament to the organization's commitment to privacy protection, affirming that "every person has the right to the protection of the law against abusive attacks upon his honour, his reputation, and his private and family life." This provision underscores the importance of safeguarding reputation, honor, as well as private and family life. Articles IX and X reinforce these principles, guaranteeing the right to the inviolability of one's home and the confidential transmission of personal correspondence. It's noteworthy that this declaration, also known as the Bogota Declaration, marked a significant step in international human rights history, becoming the second comprehensive international human rights treaty to be enacted, coming into effect within a year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) .
The OAS, through the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, firmly established privacy as a fundamental human right, contributing to the broader tapestry of international human rights protection.
3.4.3 American Convention on Human Rights, 1969: 
A noteworthy stride in Latin American human rights progress was achieved through the enactment of the American Convention on Human Rights, commonly known as the Pact of San José. This pivotal event took place on November 22, 1969, during the Inter-American Specialized Conference on Human Rights held in San José, Costa Rica . After an interval of nine months, precisely on July 18, 1978, upon the deposition of the 11th ratification instrument, the convention gained legal effect. Comprising an extensive document encompassing 82 articles, the convention safeguards an array of civil and political rights, prominently including the inviolable right to privacy. Article 11 of this accord asserts the entitlement of every individual to have their honor esteemed and their dignity acknowledged. It unequivocally proscribes any unjustifiable assaults on one's reputation or honor, and prohibits arbitrary or injurious intrusions into familial, residential, or communicative domains. It further ensures that all individuals possess a legal shield against such encroachments or affronts.
The establishment of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) ensued through a 1979 agreement, even though the Member Economies are not legally bound by the rulings of the former. It is imperative to underscore that the protection of privacy is enshrined in parallel terms within both the American Convention on Human Rights of 1969 and the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 1950, highlighting the transcontinental recognition of this fundamental right .
3.5 APEC Privacy Framework, 2005: 
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) stands as an intergovernmental institution dedicated to fostering various initiatives, including the promotion of unimpeded trade across the expansive Asia Pacific expanse. Comprising a union of 21 Member Economies, APEC focuses its efforts on the triad of business facilitation, economic and technical collaboration, and the liberalization of trade and investment. In pursuit of bolstering e-commerce within the Asia Pacific arena while respecting the sanctity of personal information, the APEC alliance embarked on formulating a privacy framework in 2003, culminating in its adoption in 2004 and completion in 2005 .
The APEC Privacy Framework is comprehensively structured into four principal segments. The preliminary section finds its place in Part I, delineating the context and intent. Part II effectively outlines the extent of the framework's applicability. Part III is of paramount significance, encompassing nine pivotal information privacy principles. These principles, akin to the OECD Privacy Guidelines, encompass aspects such as the prevention of harm, notification, constraints on data collection, appropriate usage of personal data, individual choice, the preservation of personal data's accuracy, and the fortification of security measures. Part IV takes up the mantle of detailing the framework's operational implementation.
It is essential to underline that while the APEC Privacy Framework's guiding tenets offer a standardized foundation for regional privacy regulations, they lack a binding legal mandate on the Member Economies. Instead, these nations have agreed to collaborate through their respective national regulatory agencies to address the intricate matter of cross-border data transmission. The framework additionally underscores the significance of self-regulation. Most significantly, the APEC Privacy Framework earned its distinction as one of the pivotal global privacy mechanisms akin to Directive 95/46/EC. For more comprehensive insights into these privacy principles, reference can be made to APEC's 2005 APEC Privacy Framework.
3.5.1 Updated APEC Privacy Framework, 2015:
The foundations of the APEC Privacy Framework of 2005 can be traced back to the OECD Privacy Guidelines of 1980, which served as its initial blueprint. The evolving landscape prompted the OECD to revise these guidelines in 2013, thus prompting APEC to undertake its own revision in 2015, taking into account the 2013 Revised OECD Guidelines. This updated iteration introduced several noteworthy elements, including the Cross Border Privacy Rules System (CBPR System), the APEC Cross Border Privacy Enforcement Arrangement (CPEA), the Privacy Enforcement Authority (PEA), the Privacy Recognition for Processors System (PRP System), Accountability Agents, and Interoperability .
Of particular significance within the 2015 Updated APEC Privacy Framework is the concept of "interoperability" of privacy standards among member economies. This principal advocates for the free flow of personal data across the region, promoting the compatibility of various privacy instruments in alignment with the APEC Privacy Framework. This global interoperability is deemed crucial for both upholding individuals' right to privacy on an international scale and enabling authorities to effectively enforce cross-border privacy regulations .
However, it's important to acknowledge that the APEC Privacy Framework exhibits certain weaknesses compared to the comprehensive OECD Privacy Guidelines. While some principles like "purpose specification" and "openness" are absent, the APEC framework introduces novel concepts such as "preventing harm," "choice," and "due diligence in transfers" under the "accountability principle." This revised framework, however, has faced criticisms, including requirements for consumers to provide evidence, the exclusive application of privacy principles to natural persons, and its silence on automated data collection tools like cookies. In conclusion, while the APEC Privacy Framework lacks enforceable starting dates or penalties for non-compliance, its effectiveness relies heavily on the commitment of Member Economies to adhere to its regulations in order to achieve its intended objectives.
3.6 Madrid Resolution, 2009: 
On November 5, 2009, an important stride in privacy and data protection law took shape as the Madrid Resolution, endorsed during an international conference in Madrid. Crafted by the national data protection agencies of 50 diverse nations, this pivotal document not only underscored the universality of the right to privacy but also introduced guiding principles and safeguards to enhance the protection of individuals' rights, particularly in the context of cross-border data transfers. This resolution operated under a dual mandate: firstly, to establish a comprehensive framework of principles and rights ensuring consistent global safeguarding of personal data, and secondly, to facilitate the seamless cross-border flow of data, a vital element in today's interconnected world.
Embedded within the Resolution were the responsibilities of data controllers and the entitlements of data subjects, encompassing essential provisions such as the right to access, rectification, and objection, mirroring conventional data protection norms. What set the Resolution apart was its directive that data controllers communicate any instances of data breaches to affected individuals—a departure from previous data protection mechanisms. Core data protection principles, referred to as Basic Principles, were embedded within the resolution, encompassing elements such as legality, fairness, purpose specification, proportionality, data quality, openness, and accountability .
Article 22 of the Resolution articulated proactive measures, accompanied by a spectrum of innovations. These innovations spanned diverse areas, including methods for breach prevention and identification, the appointment of data protection officers (DPOs), regular training and awareness initiatives, periodic audits, technology adjustments, privacy impact assessments, adoption of codes of practice, and the implementation of response plans. Notably, influential international corporations like Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Procter & Gamble issued an endorsement applauding the Madrid Resolution for its comprehensive set of rules, guidelines, legal protections, and duties that formed the bedrock for effective data protection systems. The Resolution emerged as a pioneering step toward establishing an international standard for data protection legislation, holding the potential to reshape the landscape of data privacy across the globe .
3.7 ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, 2012, and ASEAN Framework on Personal Data Protection, 2016:
The five founding states, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, signed the ASEAN Declaration on August 8, 1967, establishing the Association of Southeast Asian states (ASEAN) as a regional economic organization. The ASEAN now has 10 member states as a result of the addition of five more member nations to the conference. In particular, Lao PDR and Myanmar joined on July 23, 1997, followed by Cambodia on April 30, 1999, Lao PDR and Myanmar on July 23, 1995, and Brunei Darussalam on January 7, 1984.
The ASEAN Human Rights Declaration was first drafted in 2012 by the Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights of ASEAN, and it was unanimously endorsed on November 18, 2012, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The Declaration, which is divided into 40 paragraphs and 6 headings, reaffirms ASEAN's commitment to human rights. In the same vein as the UDHR and ICCPR, the Declaration recognizes privacy as one of the "Civil and Political Rights." For instance, the Declaration's Article 21 states:
Every individual has the right to be free from arbitrary intrusions into their privacy, families, homes, or correspondence, including attacks on their reputation and honor. Every individual has a right to legal protection from such intrusions or assaults.
Whereas, on November 25, 2016, in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam, the ASEAN nations' telecommunications and information technology ministers adopted the ASEAN Framework on Personal Data Protection. Seven Principles of Personal Data Protection are included in the Framework, including among others: (1) Consent, notice, and purpose; (2) Accuracy of Personal Data; (3) Security Measures; (4) Access and Correction; (5) Transfers to Other Countries or Territories; (6) Retention; and (7) Accountability.
The Framework intends to improve ASEAN's data protection standards and promote member nation collaboration. Additionally, it helps to support and increase transnational data flows as well as regional and global trade. The Framework, however, simply functions as a record, and as a result, neither expressly nor implicitly, under either local or international law, does it impose any legally enforceable obligations.
3.8 The EU Instruments
Europe stands as the vanguard of data privacy laws, boasting the oldest, most comprehensive, and stringent regulations, operational at both national and regional levels. The European Union (EU) not only champions data protection within its boundaries but also aspires to mold the international data protection landscape through its cross-border entities. Four distinct temporal phases mark the trajectory of data protection legislation in the EU: the era of national data protection regimes (1970–1980), internationalization (1980–1981), national implementation (1982–1994), and European harmonization (1995–2016/2018).
A striking facet is the EU's concerted effort to counter the dominant US position in this arena by adopting a holistic approach to privacy legislation. This endeavor is evident in a series of influential documents with far-reaching global implications, including the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1950), the Council of Europe Convention (1981), the Modernized Convention (Convention 108+, 2018), Directive 95/46/EC (1995), and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, 2018) .
Pioneering this legislative journey was the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, instituted in 1950. Serving as the foundational text for the Council of Europe's entire data protection framework, this treaty upholds individuals' right to privacy and family life. Article 8 of the Convention embodies this principle, stating that everyone is entitled to the inviolability of their home, communications, and personal and family life. The Convention's enforcement is channeled through the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR or ECtHR), where individuals can lodge complaints after exhausting domestic avenues of appeal. The ECHR's over 16,000 rulings since its inception in 1959 have significantly influenced EU legislation and fortified the rule of law across the region .
3.8.1 Convention 108 of the Council of Europe, 1981:
A pivotal data protection instrument of profound significance is the 1981 Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, also known as Convention 108 of the Council of Europe. This convention stands as a notable milestone, often hailed as the accomplishment in data protection subsequent to the OECD Guidelines. Endorsed in 1981, Convention 108 was made available for signing and officially came into force the subsequent year. What distinguishes this convention is its transformation from a regional accord into the world's first legally binding international agreement in its domain, evidenced by its ratification by non-EU Member States since 2013 .
Convention 108 doesn't seek to delineate the concepts of privacy or personal data, but instead aims to impose limitations on the utilization of sensitive personal data. These constraints are essential due to the formidable challenges posed to data privacy in light of the escalating integration of computers into organizational operations. Every signatory of Convention 108 is obligated to undertake specific domestic legislative measures, rendering this convention highly influential in shaping the legal frameworks of major European nations. Consequently, nations lacking privacy laws or data havens find themselves isolated under the provisions of Convention 108, compelling many European Union member states to enact data privacy legislation. The fundamental principles for data protection are encapsulated in Chapter II of the Convention (Articles 4–11), serving as a robust foundation adaptable to various regional legal and constitutional contexts.
Recognizing the evolving landscape of data management, the Council of Europe embarked on a significant endeavor in 2001, necessitating the revision of several clauses within Convention 108. These amendments carried pivotal implications, particularly concerning the facilitation of transnational data transfers to non-Member States and the prerogatives of national supervisory bodies. The process commenced with an in-depth review facilitated by a consultative committee, which underscored the need to reevaluate Convention 108 against the backdrop of emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs). This assessment highlighted challenges and complexities that the application of the convention faced, necessitating modernization as the sole viable solution. Subsequently, in August 2001, the authorization of an Additional Protocol focused on transnational data flows and supervisory agencies marked a decisive step in the modification journey.
Convention 108 delineates a framework that permits the collection and processing of personal data, albeit with restrictions on sensitive categories of data encompassing attributes such as race, sex, health, sexual life, political or religious beliefs, and criminal records. The convention further endows individuals with the right to access and update their personal information, with exceptions made only in cases of paramount state security, national defense, or matters of public significance. Moreover, the convention imposes constraints on cross-border data transfers if the recipient third nations fail to ensure adequate legal safeguards for the protection of personal data.
The European Council, prioritizing safety and security, embraced the exchange of personal data as early as November 2004. The Hague Program exemplified this approach by granting law enforcement agencies across the EU access to substantial repositories of personal and biometric data. Notably, the T-PD Committee's amendment of Convention 108 and its supplementary protocol in November 2012 marked a comprehensive modernization effort. The resultant updated iteration of Convention 108 embarks on a multi-faceted journey of progress. Together, the OECD Privacy Guidelines of 1980, Convention 108, and the entirety of the Council of Europe's data protection initiatives collectively establish the global benchmarks for data privacy legislation.
3.8.2 Modernized Convention of Council of Europe (Convention 108+), 2018:
The Convention 108's fundamental privacy principles had stood the test of time, and its technical neutrality and principle-based approach made it an unquestioned strength, but the Council of Europe still believed it was necessary to update its benchmark document. The Council of Europe accepted the amending Protocol (ETS No. 108) for the modernization process during its 128th Committee of Ministers Session, which took place on May 17–18, 2018, in Elsinore, Denmark. This was followed by a public consultation that began in 2011. Convention 108, the only legally enforceable worldwide data protection document, was updated in May 2018 after seven years of heated discussion and debate.
This modernisation has two major goals: improving the Convention's implementation procedures and resolving privacy issues brought on by the use of new information and communication technologies. However, the following can be used to encapsulate the innovations of Modernized Convention 108:
•	The updated Convention gave data subjects several additional rights, such as the right to object and the right to be exempt from automated decision-making, profiling, and algorithms.
•	The updated Convention enhances several of the basic data protection principles while also adding some additional safeguards that are crucial.
•	The list of special types of data now includes biometric and genetic data.
•	It set additional requirements on controllers, including responsibility, openness, reporting of data breaches, risk analysis, privacy by design and by default, etc.
•	It revised the rules governing cross-border data transfers and, when necessary, extended these duties to data processors.
•	It emphasized collaboration for the performance of their tasks and reinforced the authority of supervisory agencies.
•	A monitoring system was developed by the updated Convention to make sure that signatories adhered to their commitments.
The updated Convention 108 has brought forth elevated standards across various domains, encompassing sensitive data handling, personal data anonymization, the establishment of an autonomous Data Protection Authority (DPA), legal recourse avenues, restrictions on data transfers, and more. Evidently, the revised Convention 108 sets forth requisites that significantly surpass the benchmarks set by the original Convention 108 and its 2001 Additional Protocol .
Furthermore, the evolving face of Convention 108 underscores its unique status as the sole feasible data protection standard. This assertion finds foundation in the provisions of Article 23 (Accession by Non-Member States) of Convention 108, Article 27 (Accession by Non-Member States or International Organizations) of the Modernized Convention 108, Recital 105 (Consideration of International Agreements for an Adequacy Decision) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and aligns with the aspirations of the Council of Europe's leadership. Despite facing challenges in terms of acceptance rates since 2013, the Convention 108+, through its growing global membership beyond Europe, makes strides toward realizing its ambitious objective.
3.8.3 Directive 95/46/EC, 1995:
The Council of Europe has developed various initiatives for assuring the protection of privacy, handling of personal data, and free flows of data with a great deal of success. The Council has had a number of difficulties in keeping all of its data protection policies uniform throughout the Member States at the same time. Therefore, it was crucial to make an effort at the national level to harmonize regional data protection methods and procedures. 'Directive 95/46/EC on the Protection of Individuals with respect to the Processing of Personal Data and On the Free Movement of such Data' (Directive 95/46/EC) was adopted on October 24, 1995, following nearly five years of vigorous efforts and discussions. Due to the GDPR's 2018 repeal, the provisions of this document no longer have the status or significance they once did .
3.8.4 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 2018: 
The GDPR, which has become a catchphrase, has had a significant impact on international data protection laws. The GDPR spreads internationally as a benchmark for data protection regulation due to its all-encompassing legislative content, wide extraterritorial extent, and the EU's significant market strength. As a result, it has become customary for governments all over the world to implement new data privacy laws or change existing ones to comply with GDPR. One must have at least a basic comprehension of the abbreviation "GDPR" unless they are living under a rock due to the roles, influences, legal, textual, and contextual highness of GDPR.
The European Commission (EC) made a proposal that started the GDPR lifecycle in January 2012. It was adopted on April 27, 2016, and it ultimately went into force on May 25, 2018. It superseded the earlier Directive 95/46/EC and brought about several significant changes in practically every area, from technology to advertising, from banking to medical. It is regarded as one of the most extensive and thorough pieces of Regulations, addressing all potential issues that individuals may encounter with regard to their personal data in the digital era. It is asserted that with the implementation of the GDPR, EU citizens would now be aware of how firms use personal data and how to take advantage of the finest prospects presented by the data-based economy. The EU did the correct thing given that businesses needed certainty to expand operations securely within the area and that recent data scandals necessitated clearer and better data protection legislation .
According to Article 3, the GDPR is applicable to any data controller or processor with a presence in the EU who handles the personal data of EU citizens wherever the processing takes place. Even when supplying products or services to EU citizens and tracking their behavior, foreign controllers or processors are subject to the GDPR. Since you are considered a target of EU legislation if you target or monitor EU citizens, the long arm of GDPR is extended to span the entire world. Since non-compliance with the GDPR can result in significant fines and penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of annual sales, whichever is larger, it causes anxiety around the globe .
As a result, the wave of GDPR-creep data protection laws throughout the globe serves as proof that the ramifications of GDPR are not only hypothetical possibilities but rather a concrete reality. Additionally, major global IT companies are modifying their business strategies to conform to the GDPR's rules. For instance, Microsoft pledged to treat all customers fairly under the GDPR regardless of where they were located and to provide them the ability to control how their personal data was accessed via the personal dashboard. Facebook has updated its privacy options and management tools to comply with the GDPR.[109] Google has modified its products and privacy practices to comply with the GDPR in the interim. Even Google simplified and clarified their privacy policy in order to comply with European legislation.
Notably, the GDPR is a lengthy, thorough, and complicated document that has 88 pages and 55,000 words spread throughout 11 chapters, 196 recitals, and 99 articles. The 'General Provisions' section of Chapter I covers a variety of topics, including 
(1) subject matter and purposes (art. 1); 
(2) material scope (art. 2); 
(3) geographical scope (art. 3); and 
(4) definitions (art. 4).
 The important privacy principles are covered in Chapter II, including: 
(1) principles relating to the processing of personal data (art. 5); 
(2) lawfulness of processing (art. 6); 
(3) conditions for consent (art. 7); 
(4) conditions applicable to children's consent (art. 8); 
(5) processing of special categories of personal data (art. 9); and 
(6) processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses (art. 10).
In Chapter III, the data subjects have a wide range of rights, including: 
(1) the right to transparent information (Articles 12–14); 
(2) the right of access by the data subject; 
(3) the right to rectification; 
(4) the right to erasure; 
(5) the right to data portability; 
(6) the right to object; 
(7) the right not to be subject to automated decision-making and profiling; and 
(8) the right not to be subject to automated decision-making and profiling. 
The subsequent chapters of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) encompass a wealth of pivotal clauses. Chapter IV, spanning Articles 24 to 43, outlines the obligations incumbent upon data controllers and processors. Chapter V, encompassing Articles 44 to 48, delves into the intricacies of transferring personal data to foreign countries or international organizations. Independent supervisory authorities are the focus of Chapter VI (Articles 51-54), while Chapter VII (Articles 60-63) covers cooperation and consistency aspects. Finally, Chapter VIII (Articles 76-84) delves into remedies, liability, and penalties .
The influence of GDPR extends beyond the EU, wielding a considerable impact on data management within its boundaries and significantly shaping global data protection norms. This influence extends even to nations not directly party to the Regulation, as emphasized by the UN Special Rapporteur's assertion that personal information protection should be prioritized globally, with GDPR-like provisions serving as a model. Consequently, several non-EU European nations, including Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, have revised their data protection regulations in alignment with GDPR. Beyond Europe, countries across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America are either enacting new data privacy laws or amending existing ones to align with GDPR. This trend is evident in at least 24 countries worldwide, where legislative developments, rulings, or harmonization tendencies in relation to GDPR have emerged .
Even within the United States, the likelihood of comprehensive data privacy legislation being enacted has significantly risen. States such as Maine and Nevada have followed the path set by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) by enacting comprehensive data privacy measures. Numerous other states, including Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington, are either introducing comprehensive privacy bills or undergoing legislative review. This global influence extends not only to economically advanced nations but also to countries categorized as 'Second World' and 'Third World'. As such, experts like Giovanni Buttarelli advocate for GDPR as a catalyst for a distinct worldwide gold standard in data protection, while scholars like Paul M. Schwartz highlight GDPR's role as a globally recognized privacy law in the contemporary technological landscape.
3.9 Privacy in the National Legal Regime
The practice of gathering personal information is as old as human society itself. One of the oldest habits, if not the oldest vocation. Due to paradigm developments in industrial and socio-economic settings, the usage of personal data has grown significantly, particularly since the 1960s. Governments were required to process enormous volumes of personal data in order to run this majority of reform-related activities, and this data processing has only gotten worse since the invention of the computer .
The computer's initial application in planning and research quickly expanded to permeate all facets of human existence. The advent of the Internet, the World Wide Web (WWW), and the continuous evolution of information and communication technology (ICT) has enabled the collection, processing, and storage of vast volumes of personal data. Technological strides like big data analytics, cloud computing, data mining, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have subsequently transformed the landscape by facilitating novel business models that analyze personal data with unprecedented depth. To navigate this intricate terrain and strike a balance between governmental, corporate, and individual interests, robust data protection legislation emerges as a necessity .
The global trajectory toward the establishment of data privacy laws gained momentum in the 1970s as a strategic response. Several Western nations, including Austria, Denmark, France, Norway, Sweden, and the USA, adopted privacy legislation reminiscent of Germany's Hessian Data Protection Act (Hessisches Datenschutzgesetz) of 1970. While Sweden's Datalagen 1973 holds the distinction of being the world's first data protection law, the Hessian Data Protection Act showcased a regional approach. Although pre-existing regulations like the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 encompassed certain data privacy elements, particularly pertaining to credit reporting agencies, it was the Privacy Act of 1974 in the USA that marked the nation's inaugural federal legislative effort in the domain of privacy protection . 
CHAPTER 4: RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION
The definition of the phrase "privacy" has been the most significant legal issue. Although there is no legal definition for the term "privacy," it was finally recognized as a right under Articles 19 and 21 of the Indian Constitution in the Puttaswami case, Supra chapter 1, following a decade of efforts to do so. The road wasn't simple; before this expression was recognized as one of the fundamental rights, it had to pass through a number of significant legal proceedings. India was still celebrating the ruling made in the Puttaswami case when, to our great dismay, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Chairman RS Sharma disclosed his Aadhar number online on July 28, 2018, defying anyone to hurt him in any way. The so-called "ethical hackers" accepted the challenge, and in less than a day, they surprisingly and shamefully succeeded in obtaining his (TRAI's Chairman) personal information .
It is impossible to dispute the criticism it carries for failing to address additional legal concerns like data privacy and data mining after carefully reviewing the facts of the case and recalling the fame it gave to the legal world by embracing "privacy" as a Fundamental Right. Will it take a few more years to overcome difficulties with data mining, sensitive personal information, and privacy in general? The use of the Aadhar Card to get necessities of life, such as a new SIM card and new LPG connections, was the only privacy concern raised in this instance. The other concerns raised above received no attention at all. 
Prior to the landmark Puttaswamy case, discussions on privacy within the constitutional context revolved around concepts such as liberty and dignity. However, these discussions fell short of comprehensively addressing the multifaceted legal dimensions associated with privacy. With the advent of the Puttaswamy judgment, Article 21 of the Indian Constitution now explicitly recognizes the right to privacy, providing it with its rightful legal standing. The architecture of privacy legislation generally encompasses two primary components. The first component entails specifying the circumstances under which third parties can access, utilize, and disseminate personal information of individuals. This facet is significantly influenced by cultural nuances, as different nation-states possess varying interpretations of what constitutes private information .
The second component of privacy legislation, akin to the first, is also shaped by the nation's perspective on the state's role in safeguarding this right, along with cultural differentials. Tracing back to 1980, a pivotal contribution to the discourse emerged in the form of a paper titled "The Right of Privacy" published in the Harvard Law Review by two Boston lawyers. In India, the Supreme Court, invoking Article 21, made multiple attempts to delineate the contours of the term "privacy" through a series of judgments. Despite legal frameworks like the Information Technology Act of 2000, which confers legal recognition to electronic commerce activities and includes provisions for both protection and penalties, modern concerns surrounding privacy, data protection, data mining, e-contract legality, and more continue to occupy the minds of scholars, researchers, and the general public within the digital world.
To create a comprehensive law governing e-Commerce, several amendments have modified as well as added new or additional sections, but the Information Technology (Amended) Act, 2008 has miserably failed to provide a precise and generally accepted definition of the terms "privacy," "data privacy," and "sensitive personal information." Numerous circumstances, including actions that are deemed to be criminal, can violate someone's privacy, whether they are doing it offline or online. Technology has impacted personal privacy along with personal data, and it continues to have an impact on how we perceive privacy. The idea of privacy varies from person to person, however by taking into account the taxonomy of privacy with its varied forms, we may cut through the confusion around the term "privacy." 
4.1 The Legal Issues of Privacy and Data Protection in e-Commerce
In examining the nexus of e-Commerce, privacy, and data protection, it becomes evident that the terms "legal" and "techno-legal," while not synonymous, share a complementary relationship that warrants comprehensive consideration. The bifurcation of concerns in the data protection and privacy within e-Commerce manifests in two distinct categories. Firstly, the acknowledgment surfaces that these pivotal concepts lack precise definitions within the purview of Indian statutes and laws. Secondly, the spotlight is cast on the intricate challenges engendered by privacy and data protection in the e-Commerce landscape, in alignment with relevant legislative enactments.
The conspicuous absence of a legally established definition for the term "privacy" notwithstanding, its centrality within the digital epoch remains undeniable. The lacuna in legal definition renders the preservation of privacy, notably in e-Commerce, an intricate undertaking. The proliferation of digital transactions, involving diverse stakeholders operating across multiple jurisdictions, has accentuated concerns about the unauthorized exploitation of personal data. This apprehension reverberates globally, with nations like India grappling with heightened apprehensions concerning privacy and data security, spurred by technological advancements. While Indian legislative frameworks abstain from unequivocal delineations of "privacy," a conscious effort is invested in penalizing violations . 
The Information Technology Act, though evading a precise definition, extends punitive measures for infringements, thereby generating a conundrum surrounding its interpretive scope. This predicament within Indian jurisprudence extends to "privacy," embracing diverse nuances such as territorial privacy, online privacy, data privacy, and information privacy—each necessitating explication and coalescence into a comprehensive legal lexicon. These intricacies are methodically explored under the segment "Legal Issues in Defining Privacy," underscoring the imperative of a cohesive legal framework to define "privacy." Recognizing the variation of privacy perceptions among individuals and nations, it is evident that an overarching, universally accepted definition is indispensable to grapple effectively with these concerns, both within domestic boundaries and across the international arena .
4.2 Constitution of India
Upon meticulous examination of the trajectory of privacy laws in India, it is evident that these legal frameworks have primarily originated from torts and the Indian Constitution. The architecture of the right to privacy has been intricately woven by the judiciary through a creative interpretation of Articles 19 (1) (a) and 21 of the Indian Constitution. While both these legal pillars aimed to safeguard privacy, they employed distinct approaches in achieving this goal. Notably, the common law principle of compensatory damages in cases of privacy infringement finds recognition, and Article 21 institutes essential limitations on such encroachments, bolstering the foundation of privacy protection.
The right to privacy, having secured its place as a fundamental human right on the global stage, stands as an integral tenet within contemporary legal doctrine. Its prominence is undebatable in recognizing the essence of human individuality. This significance finds formal acknowledgment through international and regional treaties that firmly endorse human rights within the framework of international law. These treaties underscore privacy as a core value. The trajectory of Indian legal principles is significantly influenced by international agreements, with India's ratification contributing to the infusion of these concepts into the nation's legal landscape. This symbiotic relationship between international standards and Indian jurisprudence has profoundly shaped the evolution of rights in India. While historical strides have been undertaken to fortify privacy laws, a comprehensive legislative framework addressing the intricate legal, techno-legal, and regulatory intricacies pertinent to safeguarding privacy and data protection in the e-Commerce remains an ongoing endeavour. 
The Indian Constitution did not previously guarantee the right to privacy explicitly, but through a number of rulings over the years, the nation's judges have interpreted other constitutional rights most notably, Article 21 as giving rise to the right to privacy. Different privacy genres have been observed over time, and the Apex court of India has rendered decisions in various case statutes. The right to privacy was not previously directly regarded as one of the Fundamental Rights. An illustration of this may be seen in the case of Kharak Singh Supra, which simply said that it is a component of Article 21. Another instance where the Supreme Court has ruled that the right to privacy is protected by Article 21 and that there is a connection between Article 19 (1) (a) and 21 that ensures privacy in one or the other is R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu. The Supreme Court also emphasized on the idea of seclusion, holding that an individual should be in charge of their personal information on marriage, pregnancy, families, education, and other topics . 
A violation of the right to privacy, which is indirectly protected by Articles 19 (1) (a) and 21, would result from the dissemination of such material without prior authorization and knowledge. In Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan, the position that the fundamental rights must be interpreted in accordance with the terms of international treaties and conventions to which India is a party was established with regard to the applicability of international privacy jurisprudence in India. It is believed that foreign legal tools have a significant role in Indian municipal law. The fundamental tenets of international human rights law also significantly influence local law. As a result, decisions made using these tools might form the foundation for the development of privacy law in India . 
In its ruling on the first privacy case, the Supreme Court acknowledged the right to privacy as a fundamental human right. The majority did not, however, grant constitutional protection to privacy. The court used the same strategy in Gobind v. State of M.P. It noted the decisions in support of a limited right to privacy from the case of Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh with satisfaction. In R. Rajagopal v. State of T.N., the Supreme Court of India conducted a thorough analysis of privacy as a right, accepting that "right to be let alone" fits within the purview of Article 21 while recognizing privacy as a significant human right concern. The claims that privacy is one of the fundamental human rights are further supported by provisions of the ECHR and ICCPR. This right is correctly construed from the wording of Article 21 and is not in conflict with municipal legislation. 
As a result, the Supreme Court has decided that the principles included in the ECHR, UDHR, and ICCPR are a part of Indian legislation on privacy. No matter where a person belongs, the "right to privacy" is protected by human rights legislation. The "right to privacy" has been acknowledged as one of the most important human rights thanks to the efforts of this Law. Although this right was not widely acknowledged in India and lacked a bill providing legal support, it was frequently disputed in court. Our Constitution's two main pillars, Article 19 (1) (a) and Article 21, include "privacy" as one of the essential fundamental rights. There was a problem with the 'right to privacy' of persons being protected in the public sphere since this right did not extend beyond its protection against third parties. The Apex Court acknowledged the existence of "private law actions" in the context of bridging this right and creating a connection between the two. As a result, the breach of privacy may be rectified by legal lawsuits seeking injunctions and damages . 
The right to privacy has evolved since it first emerged as a basic freedom. The scope of this right currently encompasses the majority of aspects of human existence and individuality, including women's rights, sexual interactions, and physical privacy. Individuals' right to privacy started to be governed by legislation. In M.P. v. Satish Chandra, supra, the Supreme Court rejected to ascribe a constitutional element of privacy to the initial argument for a right to private. 
The right to privacy now enjoys the same legal protections as other fundamental rights. It is crucial to remember that, with a few notable exceptions, the only way the State may limit basic rights granted to the person is via legislation. As stated in P.D. Shamdasani v. Central Bank of India Ltd ., such an interpretation will not shield a person from the activities of other parties. In the Auto Shanker case, the Supreme Court established privacy as a right that qualifies for damages when it is violated without the owner's knowledge or permission .
4.3 Legal Issues in Privacy
If the government so chooses, it may safeguard its citizens' "privacy."68 Privacy is extremely difficult to define. Today's virtual environment has led to the legal and cultural acceptance of privacy. But because various legal systems place a varied emphasis on them, it differs. It might be difficult to conceptualize privacy and the right to privacy. Various variations exist based on the circumstance. The challenge the e-Users face is one of a legal nature. Because of "Cloud Computing," the problem is not only confined to Indian law but affects everyone worldwide. The concept of "privacy" has been defined as a person's wish to control how widely his or her information is shared . 
Some authors believe that each person's decision to keep their communication private is their right to do so. Prior to the Puttaswami case, a person's right to privacy applied exclusively to his or her property; but, after that ruling, privacy has become one of the fundamental freedoms established in the Indian Constitution. And a person can now use it against the State. Even after this triumphant ruling by the Supreme Court, the legal questions associated with the ambiguous definition of the term "privacy" continue to be unresolved. The demand for privacy and its acknowledgment came to the fore with the sweeping shift in the cyber network, threat of being interrupted, and fear of losing control over personal information in the platform of virtual world. Each and every person would expect their right to privacy to be respected. 
A common definition of "privacy" will not only assist resolve the legal difficulty it raises, but it will also support the remedies in the case of intrusion. It is nothing new for people to be intruded upon. Even in the past, when technology was still a foreign concept to society and the internet represented an unknown danger, people were being watched. One outcome of the risk from the previous age is privacy tort law. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, people could secretly record their private moments using recorders and snap cameras. This means that people were being watched even in the absence of technical innovation, and now that technology is advancing, this has acquired velocity and poses a serious threat to people's privacy. In other words, privacy was not seen as a significant component of people's lives back then. 
Press used to make money by selling people's private information, including their private images, without their agreement. Samuel Warren and Louis Brandels, two eminent scholars, are responsible for the creation of tort privacy. They promoted "privacy" as a crucial component of safeguarding an individual's freedom to develop his individuality free from unwanted publicity and unauthorized access by others in the 1890s. William Prosser reorganized the Privacy Tort and conceptualized it under four wrongs about 70 years later. According to him, privacy tort law safeguarded against emotional, reputational, and property harm brought on by the following: 
(1) public exposure of private facts; 
(2) intrusion on solitude; 
(3) false portrayal of another; and 
(4) appropriation of another's image for profit. 
The evolution of modern tort law, exemplified by Prosser's contributions, brought forth a nuanced framework to address harm within a legal context. However, this formulation, while encompassing various facets of harm, fell short in comprehending the intrinsic privacy interest that tort law aims to safeguard. As emphasized by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis, this deficiency curtailed an individual's freedom to foster their identity. Analyzing Prosser's reimagining of tort law's "right to privacy," scholars like Danielle Keats Citron have highlighted its limitations, asserting its inadequacy in encompassing the intricate privacy concerns catalyzed by networked technology. Despite both historical and contemporary instances of privacy invasions causing intangible emotional and reputational distress, courts demanded tangible evidence of these elusive injuries, often of minor nature, thereby constraining the legal redress available to victims .
Tracing the trajectory of privacy infringement, it is evident that the landscape has transformed significantly. In the past, privacy breaches primarily circulated through newspapers, confined by their transient shelf-life and limited accessibility. However, the digital era has ushered in an era where privacy violations are broadcasted to a vast and enduring audience, accessible regardless of geographical constraints. The immediacy of information retrieval through a single click has amplified the repercussions of privacy breaches. This is particularly accentuated by the prevalent cloud computing paradigm, which has facilitated heightened third-party control over sensitive personal and group data. Consequently, the risk to individuals' privacy, augmented by the internet's persistence and ease of search, magnifies emotional and reputational harm. The menace of "Data Theft," wherein third parties exploit untraceable individuals, exacerbates reputational and emotional injuries, marking a profound shift in the scope of privacy violations . 
In the 1990s, privacy intrusion solely caused psychological and reputational loss; however, with the development of technology and the digital network, the taxonomy of privacy intrusion has entered a new phase. Prosser's tort law focused on tort damage brought on by risks; that is to say, he took a constrained approach to protecting an individual's right to privacy and placed greater emphasis on the losses resulting from privacy invasion. Oliver Wendell Holmes served as an example of this harm-based approach, explaining that "the evil against which tort law was directed was the inflicting of harm and tort law protected against harms and remedied them not because they were wrong but because they were harms." 
In contrast, G. Edward White called Prosser's approach "Consensus Thought." On the other hand, Anita Bernstein concurred that Prosser's fusion of theology and policymaking was essential to the success of his privacy taxonomy. Despite his dominance in tort law and a practical approach to privacy invasion in the twentieth century, many current privacy damage go uncompensated. It is difficult to define privacy beneath a glass ceiling since everyone's notion of privacy is different. With the development of technology, the idea of privacy is evolving and is no longer just associated with the word "privacy." The incontrovertible spheres of privacy and data serve as a map for identifying harm and identifying issues related to its protection . 
The distinct fields of "privacy" and "data" will make it easier to understand the continuous problems with privacy and data protection in the dangers of e-Commerce. The idea of "Information Privacy" or "Personal Data" has frequently come up in conversation. There are several sorts of privacy that have been identified, but none of them specifically identify privacy as a separate subject. 
i.	Territorial privacy: It is a type of privacy that limits intrusion into people's life, whether they are in an office, a market, or an open area. Genetic privacy mostly refers to the right to possess complete control over one's personal information pertaining to their private lives and is protected from outside parties. 
ii.	Online Privacy: In a nation like India, the topic of online privacy is not one that is easily discussed. The right of data subjects to live in peace on the network and have their personal information protected in line with the law is referred to as the right to cyberspace privacy of personal information. Without the subject's voluntary consent, it shall not be violated, known, collected, copied, disclosed, or used. Online privacy, cyber privacy, and internet privacy are frequently used interchangeably. The three essential components are individual field, private information, and personal data. It is a reference to the level of protection for online personal data.It consists of a number of elements, strategies, and tools that are applied to safeguard private and sensitive information, communications, and preferences. Adware, spyware, and hijacking are a few instances of privacy-invasive software that violates user privacy and is spread for profit.
iii.	'Data Privacy' or 'Information Privacy': According to Wikipedia, 'Data Privacy' or 'Information Privacy' is the gathering and sharing of data.
4.3.1 Information Technology Act, 2000 (Act 21 of 2000)
The Information Technology Act, sometimes known as the I.T. Act of 2000, is the most important piece of law. It also had some goals that could be clearly classified into three categories . This Act specifically follows the UNCITRAL Model Law in the domain of e-commerce. The first was to give e-Commerce transactions legal legitimacy, the second was to allow people to submit papers to government entities electronically, and the third was to change some laws. Legal confirmation of electronic contracts and electronic document identification are further crucial elements. The Act's original structure had sections, chapters, and schedules. Each Indian State is covered by this Act. If someone violates this Act while using a computer located in Indian Territory, they will face penalties. The phrase "it shall extend to the whole of India" appears in the preamble of this Act . 
The legislative scope of this Act extends beyond Indian citizens, encompassing individuals of all nationalities in cases where an offense is perpetrated outside the borders of India. Moreover, certain provisions of other Indian statutes have undergone amendment to remain aligned with the dynamic contours of modern technology. This Act's relevance is underpinned by the evolution of the internet, an innovation rooted in information technology that has paved the way for transformative modes of commerce, prominently manifested in e-commerce—a dominant facet of contemporary life. Fueled by computers, internet connectivity, and the expansive cyberspace, e-commerce has burgeoned in significance.
However, a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between "internet" and "cyberspace" remains elusive to many. In elucidating these concepts, the case of ACLU v. Reno offers clarity. The term "internet," as delineated by the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in this case, denotes a sprawling network that interconnects myriad individual computers, constituting a network of networks. Conversely, "cyberspace," as elucidated in the same case, represents an expansive domain where individuals with internet access can leverage an array of communication and information retrieval tools. These tools, such as electronic mail, mailing services, newsgroups, chat rooms, and the World Wide Web, transcend fixed definitions due to their ever-evolving nature. Unified by the overarching medium of "cyberspace," these tools transcend geographical confines, providing worldwide accessibility to individuals connected to the internet .
The legislative ambit of the Act extends universally, influencing not only Indian citizens but individuals worldwide. It aligns with the transformative potential of the internet and its offspring, e-commerce, while encapsulating the intricate dimensions of "internet" and "cyberspace" within its purview.
4.3.2 Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008
The Parent Act of 2000 focused on advancing the IT industry, regulating online shopping, e-government, and combating cybercrime. It was thought that the Information Technology Act, 2000 needed to be amended since it did not handle emerging cybercrimes. An modification was approved by the Parliament in 2008 to include additional cybercrimes, and it became operative on October 27, 2009. The Information Technology Act of 2000 has been expanded by the Information Technology Amendment Act of 2008 . 
The amendments brought about some notable changes, such as modifying the definition of "communication device" to include concepts like "current use," "validation of electronic signatures," and "contracts" in order to hold the original IP address owner accountable for content accessed and distributed. The problem is that the terms "privacy" and "data privacy" are not defined either in the Act of 2000 or the Act of 2008. The Information Technology Act of 2008 stipulates U/S 66 E as the penalty for privacy violations. In this modern age, where the notion of privacy is highly important and constantly endangered by the use of computers and the internet, this part is ambiguous and ineffective . 
This phrase is not limited to a person's personal space. In our technologically advanced age, privacy encompasses a wide range of other things and must be preserved in every way possible. The right to privacy was declared a basic right by the Supreme Court of India and is now also protected by the Information Technology Act, 2008, which is another crucial element of the Indian Constitution. Incorporating this phrase alongside data privacy would broaden the subject's application and aid in section 66E's modification or amendment in light of the current state of cybercrime.
4.3.3 The Indian Contract Act, 1872 
A virtual world contract is different from one that occurs in a physical market. Making an e-Contract that is legitimate and enforceable is a problem in e-commerce. The issue "How can e-contracts be formed, performed, and enforced as parties replace paper documents with e-media" is the most frequently questioned one. The Indian Contract statute, 1872 must be studied with the Information Technology Act, 2000 because the latter is just an enabling statute and does not address contractual issues related to the use of electronic records, such as attribution, acknowledgement, time and place of dispatch, and receipt . 
The problem in this case is that there is no direct connection between the sender and recipient on an online platform, and emails can become corrupted as they travel over the internet, creating problems with the precise timing of contract acceptance communication. The offer, acceptance, and consideration for the contract are the three basic components of a contract under the Indian Contract Act. In an e-contract, the same parts must be present, but the problem is one of online identification. In an e-Commerce transaction, the parties to the contract have no prior relationship, which raises questions about the parties' identities, capacities, and legal standing to engage into a contract. e-contracting person identification 'Digital Signature' was made a means to verify a person's identification in the virtual market by the I.T. Act, 2000 . 
The I.T. Act also gives e-contracts legal validity by establishing a way to pinpoint the precise time and location of e-mail dispatch and reception. Only when a contract complies with Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act is it deemed to be a valid contract. According to Section 2(c), when a proposal is accepted, it becomes a promise and binds the parties to the contract by granting them legal rights and responsibilities. The idea of privity of contract is also included in the Indian Contract Act, which makes it plain that only the parties to a contract are bound by it and that third parties are not eligible to bring legal action against the other party. 
In the case of K.P.M. Builders Private Limited v. National Highways Authority of India and Another, the Supreme Court meticulously delved into the intricate aspects of privity, third-party involvement, contractual rights, and obligations. The pivotal verdict established that a non-contractual third party lacks legal entitlement to seek remedies. Privity of contract, an issue prevalent in both conventional and digital spheres, assumes a more straightforward dimension in traditional contracts due to direct interactions, facilitating easier identification of parties. This complexity amplifies in the virtual realm due to the intricacies in establishing agency relationships among the parties. In virtual contracts, aside from the buyer and seller, numerous hosting websites are implicated, introducing a host of complexities surrounding the entitlements and responsibilities of third parties. This case not only underscores the legal intricacies in contractual relationships but also highlights the unique challenges presented by the online landscape .
4.4 The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992), (SEBI)
Enacted in 1988, the SEBI Act was designed to safeguard investors' interests and facilitate robust growth within the securities sector. On January 30, 1992, the Act came into effect, encompassing the entire Indian territory and entrusting oversight over activities such as stock exchange operations, mutual funds, and merchant banking. An amendment introduced in 2013, known as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Amendment) Act, 2013 (22 of 2013), brought modifications to the original Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992). Despite its comprehensive scope, the Act lacks explicit definitions and guidelines pertaining to pressing concerns of the digital era, such as privacy and data protection. In an era marked by digital advancements, investors confront these emerging challenges, warranting a closer alignment of regulatory provisions to contemporary realities. 
There were no particular regulations for the preservation of secrecy and net dealing, and securities over the internet were invalid in India. However, SEBI said that securities via the internet will become legitimate in India when the Information Technology Act was passed in 2000. This Act of 2000 also eliminated the remaining gaps. The SEBI now has a policy for collecting data. It tries to make data access easier. Various terminology including "data," "data custodian," "data analytics controller," "data seeker," "data expunging," and "data anonymization" have also been defined .
Contrary to claims made by "Business Standard Budget, 2020," the SEBI Act does not comprehensively address privacy and data concerns, despite its purported emphasis on safeguarding investors' data privacy rights. The SEBI Act, 1992, along with its subsequent amendment in 2013, lacks explicit provisions dedicated to the protection of personal data and privacy, potentially leaving a regulatory gap in this increasingly digital landscape .
4.4.1 The Consumer Protection Act, (COPRA) 1986
Applicable across India with the exception of Jammu and Kashmir, the Consumer Protection Act serves as a pivotal legal framework, devoted to safeguarding consumer interests. In line with this objective, the Act encompasses provisions for the establishment of councils and similar entities, dedicated to resolving disputes within the confines of legal mandates. Pertinent terminologies like "complainant," "complaint," and "consumer" are distinctly defined in Section 2, clauses (b), (c), and (d) respectively. A significant amendment was introduced in 2012, introducing alterations and additions to various sections. With the advancement of technology and changing times, new dimensions of consumer protection have emerged, demanding swift and efficient resolutions. To address these evolving needs, the Consumer Protection Bill, 2018, was introduced on January 5, 2018, by Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan, the Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution, in the Lok Sabha. This bill effectively supersedes the 1986 Consumer Protection Act, offering provisions pertaining to product liability and curbing deceptive business practices. Importantly, it establishes the Central Consumer Protection Council as a regulatory body and encourages mediation for the expeditious resolution of consumer concerns .
4.4.2 The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (No. 35 of 2019)
The President signed the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 (No. 35 of 2019) on August 9, 2019. With the exception of the State of Jammu & Kashmir, this Act applies to all of India. The fundamental goals of this Act were to safeguard consumer interests, establish agencies for their prompt and efficient administration, and, finally, to resolve disputes. This Act defines the terms "consumer," "consumer dispute," and "consumer rights" in sections 7, 8, and 9, respectively. Unlike the Consumer Protection Act of 1986, the word "online transactions" is included in this Act of 2019. Only six categories of unfair commercial practices, such as misleading statements and others, were included by the original 1986 Act. 
The 2019 Act introduces a noteworthy expansion by incorporating three additional provisions, notably encompassing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential personal data. A distinctive feature of this legislation lies in its comprehensive definition of "e-commerce" within section 16. This definitive terminology rectifies the shortcomings of the antiquated Consumer Protection Act of 1986, rectifying the absence of nomenclature for this crucial aspect of the contemporary digital market. The preliminary step towards this Act was the presentation of the Consumer Protection Bill No. 1 of 2018, which was deliberated upon by both Houses of Parliament prior to the enactment of the 2019 Act. This bill was primarily geared towards safeguarding consumer interests and resolving issues stemming from related or tangential matters. Envisaged as an all-encompassing solution, this bill aimed to address a spectrum of consumer protection concerns. This revision aimed to refine the decade-old 1986 Act, proposing the establishment of an executive committee to efficiently address consumer grievances, thereby enhancing consumer protection objectives . 
The 2019 Act seeks to empower consumers by enhancing the accountability of e-commerce entities. Notably, the legislation mandates transparency from businesses, compelling them to furnish users with comprehensive data handling information. A focal point is the accountability of e-commerce service providers, where businesses are held liable for inaccuracies. To address the dynamic landscape of consumer transactions, the concept of "Product Liability" is introduced, aimed at regulating the volatile consumer commerce sector. The ambit of the term "consumer" is broadened to encompass individuals purchasing from websites like Airbnb, Quikr, and Flipkart, as well as those engaging in transactions with brick and mortar establishments. Crucially, the Act establishes the Central Consumer Protection Authority, endowed with the authority to expeditiously investigate consumer complaints and exercise Suo motu powers. Furthermore, the Act attains another objective by incorporating the term "Central Authority Council" under Section 3 of Chapter II, an amendment that refines the legislative framework. The term "members," previously delineated under U/S 2 (1) (jj) of the parent Act, is now explicitly defined within the Act, contributing to its precision and efficacy .
 
CHAPTER 5: LEGAL AND REGULATORY CHALLENGES OF DATA PROTECTION AND DATA PRIVACY IN E-COMMERCE
Issues concerning regulatory provisions within our legal framework manifest predominantly at the national level, where a noticeable void persists in addressing data protection and privacy apprehensions. Despite the enactment of the Information Technology Act in 2000, aimed at bolstering e-commerce, its scope primarily revolves around electronic contracts and digital signatures, drawing inspiration from the UNCITRAL Model Law. Remarkably, the pivotal terminologies "privacy" and "data privacy," crucial in e-commerce, remain conspicuously absent throughout this Act. These terms remain undefined despite multiple amendments, the most recent being in 2008. While alternative legislation attempts to address privacy and data protection matters, such as the Code of Civil Procedure (1908), Indian Penal Code (1860), Indian Contract Act (1872), and related Information Technology Acts, none aptly tackle the complexities entailed in these evolving concerns. In light of these deficiencies, an evaluation of the present regulatory landscape becomes imperative, shedding light on the pressing privacy and data issues in e-commerce .
5.1 Issues of Security In E-Commerce
The legal dispute over privacy rights in e-commerce has eroded customers' confidence in the usage of electronic payment methods. Customers are interested in e-Commerce, but many are hesitant to participate fully due to security concerns and worries about the privacy of their personal information.
5.1.1 Issues Of Liability Of Intermediaries In E-Commerce Transaction
Internet access providers and service providers (ISPs) are the two different categories of intermediaries. In the case of Google India Private Limited v. Vishaka Industries and Others , the extent of service provider immunity was established .
5.1.2 Issues Of Choice Of Law In E-Commerce
One of the Court's most difficult decisions is the choice of law and venue in e-Commerce. Only if it has the jurisdiction can a court efficiently decide a matter. Determining the appropriate law is crucial when a situation involves issues like jurisdiction and choice of law in e-Commerce. How the issue of choosing a law and jurisdiction are to be decided, as various nations have different laws. Different nations will view the same situation differently. Only in a physical location can a court establish its jurisdiction and implement the law, but how can it do it online? Internet users come from all over the world, and each country has its own laws that are based on its own national interests. 
E-commerce disputes sometimes include parties from several nations, making it challenging to identify a single relevant legislation. In this digital age, "choice of law" is a key question that lacks an answer. Many academics have debated this topic over the years and proposed lex cyberalty—a special law for cyberspace—as a solution. When it comes to addressing "choice of law" issues, uniformity in cyber law might prove to be advantageous, especially in cases involving e-Commerce. It is imperative that India have a separate legislation for data protection due to the improper classification of databases as copyright and with comparable criteria. Privacy is tied to data protection, and if one is violated, the other would undoubtedly suffer. Tort also raises the choice of law question . 
This problem is mostly evident in e-commerce in relation to intellectual property rights, defamation, etc. This matter is important in tort law since cybercrime frequently happens when there isn't a written contract between the parties. The use of litigation in dispute resolution is a tool. 'Choice of law' and 'jurisdiction' are two issues that have endangered this tool of the Court. The global conventional manner of conducting business has been called into question in these contemporary ages, and the cause is the internet. The "choice of law" by the parties to the contract is one of the most bothersome ones in the case of a legal issue in e-Commerce. Legal professionals sometimes have trouble deciding which legislation to apply in a borderless cyberspace. When two parties from different countries are involved in a contract, selecting the appropriate choice of law clause is essential.
5.1.3 Issues Of Choice Of Forum In E-Commerce
In conventional transactions involving participants from different legal jurisdictions, the forum selection is relatively straightforward, primarily hinging on the choice of applicable national laws. The functional equivalence theory adequately handles such scenarios. However, in e-commerce, the intricacies of forum selection become notably complex due to the nuanced application of the functional equivalence principle, which proves more intricate in the digital domain than in traditional commerce. The customary principles of jurisdiction are disrupted when transactions migrate online, as the legality of actions in one jurisdiction might conflict with another. Within the sphere of e-commerce, only parties falling under the jurisdiction of Indian courts can seek injunctions, strictly adhering to the principle of jurisdiction in personam, while harmonizing with the jurisdictional authority of other courts. The critical challenge in e-commerce stems from the uncertainty surrounding the geographical location of transaction counterparts. Parties engaging in online transactions grapple with the dilemma of forum selection and identifying the appropriate entity to initiate a claim against in instances of fraud or misconduct. This underscores the unique complexities surrounding e-commerce transactions and the necessity for carefully crafted legal frameworks .
5.1.4 Issues Of Choice Of Jurisdiction In E-Commerce
The distinctive boundaries of the physical realm dissolve within the expansive confines of the cyber domain, posing a considerable challenge in formulating effective regulations for online activities. Crafting comprehensive rules to govern the virtual landscape remains a formidable endeavor, and no individual State has successfully enacted comprehensive internet legislation. The implications of inadequate regulation in the cyber domain  are particularly perilous due to the absence of tangible confines, magnifying potential risks. Addressing cross-border disputes and ascertaining the jurisdiction responsible for crafting cyber legislation presents yet another intricate conundrum that nations worldwide grapple with. Scholars of note, including Johnson and Post, underscore the diminishing relevance of physical location in cyberspace, a consequence of escalating online engagement, thereby rendering geographical boundaries less influential. This evolving dynamic has profound implications for the control and governance of individuals' online conduct, necessitating a nuanced approach to regulatory frameworks in the digital age . 
The authority of one nation is divided amongst others through jurisdiction, yet the Internet transcends national boundaries. There are at least three jurisdictions involved when e-Users do online activities. The problem here is the lack of standard, globally accepted regulations that apply to everyone. When the internet as a medium does not comprehend the limits and sovereignty, problems associated to cyberspace are invited. India is still not safe due to the "jurisdiction" issue. Over jurisdictional concerns, the I.T. Act, 2000 has been discussed and contested multiple times. When someone from one jurisdiction seeks to sue someone from another, one of the questions concerns the participation of parties from separate jurisdictions. 
The residency of the defendant and the location where the cause of action arises are the two regions that are confused. Only when personal data may freely travel across borders does international trade thrive. The problem is not with the free flow of information, but rather with the absence of adequate protections. When information moves between two member nations, the situation is not dangerous. Only when foreign countries are involved and there are no comprehensive rules to address the issue can privacy and data privacy issues pose a concern. Famous academics David R. Johnson and David Post have brought attention to the jurisdictional problem in e-Commerce. They contend that one of the challenges of the internet world is sorting out what is genuine from what is not, as people's often appear to be real. The ability to track actions that occur across borders is another concern they raise with reference to e-Commerce .
The ability of a court to hear a matter, make a decision, and issue a judgement is known as jurisdiction. The subject matter jurisdiction and the personal jurisdiction are the two categories into which jurisdiction is traditionally divided. When unlawful acts of any kind are conducted online, the question of jurisdiction arises. Tracing the geographical boundary and the Court's exercise of jurisdiction are exceedingly challenging tasks. A defendant who is a subject of many jurisdictions cannot be tried in court if there is no jurisdiction. A well-known example of a jurisdictional disagreement is Yahoo . 
A landmark case in the jurisdiction unfolded when Yahoo! was instructed by the court to expunge all Neo-Nazi related content from its online platforms. Despite Yahoo! challenging the order on the premise that it infringed upon the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the company was compelled to adhere to the directive and eliminate the contentious material. This case assumes paramount significance due to the foreign court's exercise of preliminary jurisdiction to adjudicate a matter transcending its physical borders, charting a remarkable precedent in the annals of jurisdiction. Indian courts, too, have delved into the contours of alien jurisdiction, finding guidance in Sections 20 and 75 of the Code of Civil Procedure (C.P.C.), as exemplified in the Banyan Tree case where the court deliberated on its authority to preside over the matter.
Within the sphere of e-commerce, jurisdiction and the selection of applicable law stand as pivotal considerations. Analogous to the physical realm, resolving issues of jurisdiction and legal frameworks within cyberspace proves intricate. The digital landscape, while offering convenience, introduces a medley of challenges. The globalized nature of e-commerce, with buyers and sellers spanning the globe on virtual platforms, accentuates the gravity of jurisdictional conundrums, surpassing those encountered in the physical world. The Delhi High Court, through meticulous examination of factual nuances, underscored the significance of the wrongdoer's intent in "purposefully availing" of the jurisdiction of foreign courts, with the court clarifying that mere website access does not inherently confer jurisdiction. The intersection of e-commerce, jurisdiction, and choice of law entails a complex and evolving landscape that necessitates judicious legal approaches . 
Conflict of law and venue difficulties arise as a result of this dispersed jurisdiction. The Courts' territorial jurisdiction is delineated by national boundaries. The application of the courts' jurisdictional power is questioned in online transactions. The term "data" has a fairly broad definition, encompassing both personal and business-related information about people. The first applies to intellectual property rights, while the second to privacy rights. The Indian Copyright Act, 1957 and the IT (Amended Act), 2008 safeguard data, whilst the Indian Constitution protects privacy. Therefore, it would be accurate to state that data are only loosely protected by Indian law and that no comprehensive legislation exists to address the problem of data protection. 
The concept of "privacy" as an inherent human right that must be practised by an individual without interference from others is without question.It denotes both his and our rights to share. The idea of privacy is related to and overlaps with that of liberty. They represent the two sides of one coin. The difficulty in defining the nature and boundaries of the right to privacy is a fundamental concern. Among the benefits of our Constitution are the rights to free speech and to personal liberty. The right to privacy is one of the fundamental rights discussed in these articles . 
The right to privacy in India finds its grounding in a multitude of cases, directly intertwined with safeguarding personal data. Notably, the Supreme Court, in Supreme Court of India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal, invoked Section 2 (f) of the RTI Act, 2005, defining "information" encompassing various forms, including electronic data. Addressing privacy as a fundamental right, the Supreme Court explicitly acknowledged this in Ram Jethamalani & Ors v. Union of India, marking a significant judicial assertion of this core principle.  
In India, only a small number of laws are universally applicable. The I.T. Act, introduced in 2000, is one of these laws that is applicable to all of India's states. This Act establishes prescriptive jurisdiction. International law establishes limitations on its authority.558  According to this Act, if an offence includes the use of a computer, computer system, or computer network situated in India, the offender will be punished in accordance with this Section even though the offence was committed outside of India. The problem with this Section and the Act as a whole is that they are ineffectual. It is a well-known fact that the "Internet" crosses all borders, hence it would be unreasonable to prosecute someone under this Act for acts like using an Indian computer. 
It would be completely unjust and disgusting since a computer used and situated in India may contain stuff from a foreign country that is only lawful there and banned in India. In such cases, the question would be: Can someone be prosecuted in Indian Courts for choosing to browse a website that is prohibited in India on a device under its control? Regarding its application in other countries, there is another problem. According to the functional equivalence theory, which states that an online position should be handled the same way that an offline position would be handled, it could seem simple. This strategy is effective in some sense because the same real individuals who deal online do so in the same manner as they would on a physical platform. If a person is a citizen of the same nation or is subject to the same court's jurisdiction, the law per se applies to them equally. But there are many participants in the virtual world, which is the problem. If two people from different nations are involved in the same transaction, there is no issue . 
The problem only arises when there is a contract breach, and it must be resolved in accordance with the relevant legal standards. When parties from different jurisdictions who are also citizens of the same country are separated by their own personal territory, they can resolve their dispute by deciding where to file their lawsuit in accordance with the applicable legislation. The internet has no limits and no laws, which is not the case with eCommerce. The Internet has no boundaries and does not take the issue of jurisdictional disputes into account. Many lawmakers, proponents of privacy and data security, and academics from all around the world have been troubled by the internet's insensitivity. 
There is an unending study gap between the topics of choice of law and jurisdiction and privacy and data protection. The court considers the entirety of the circumstances while exercising its internet jurisdiction in order to have a deeper understanding of the online behaviours of those concerned. The Information Technology Act of 2000 governs the jurisdiction of Indian courts over acts carried out online. According to section 1's clause (2), this Act is to be expanded to include acts committed by individuals outside of Indian territory. However, it is unclear how this clause and the whole Act would apply to such acts committed outside of India . 
The traditional delineation of jurisdictional boundaries is undergoing swift transformation due to the burgeoning online activities within cyberspace. Contrary to some prominent legal scholars, Dr. Talat Fatima, Principal of Government Law College, challenges the notion that territorial jurisdiction cannot be extended into the virtual realm. In her perspective, as long as individuals can access and engage with the internet, the assertion that territorial jurisdiction is inapplicable in cyberspace remains unfounded. Dr. Fatima contends that the obstacles stemming from legal complexities in addressing online activities and the inadequacies of existing regulatory frameworks constitute the primary reasons behind the perceived failure of this notion .
5.2 Personal Cyberspace Jurisdiction
Only in enforceable jurisdictions do courts use their authority. Personal cyberspace jurisdiction is limited to the extent to which a court's subject-matter jurisdiction is applicable. The two most important factors in determining personal cyberspace jurisdiction are determination and application. The primary factor that a court considers when evaluating its personal jurisdiction is "physical presence." In order to exercise its personal online jurisdiction, the court must first determine whether a party is a resident or a nonresident. Traditional societies confine a country's ability to exercise authority to its borders. But in the US, the situation is different since the jurisdiction is established after taking into account the authority of the relevant courts with regard to the cause of action. 
In the United States, the 'minimum contacts' doctrine prevails, wherein even a minimal connection with the forum state is deemed sufficient to establish jurisdiction over non-resident entities. As the e-Commerce and the internet proliferates globally, the existing legal framework faces challenges in effectively regulating these dynamics. To counteract this, the US employs extraterritorial jurisdiction and long-arm statutes, empowering courts to entertain cases involving defendants lacking residency within their jurisdiction. In scrutinizing 'cross-border issues', two perspectives—'prescriptive' and 'enforcement'—are employed .
The 'prescriptive' perspective illustrates a state's capacity to formulate and enforce its laws on situations falling within its purview. On the other hand, the 'enforcement' standpoint delves into a state's reliance on jurisdictional authority when exerting control over events or entities situated beyond its territorial boundaries. In the internet, determining geographical jurisdiction is intricate, impeding the court's adjudication process. The traditional standards applied to physical borders find limitations in the cyberspace context. Consequently, consumers grapple with uncertainty regarding the appropriate forum and governing laws for disputes. This dilemma extends to the quandary of selecting the right party to sue and the suitable jurisdiction. Even as these challenges are addressed, the issue of 'choice of law' within the virtual sphere remains unresolved, adding complexity to the regulatory landscape.
5.3 The Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023
Personal data, comprising information that can uniquely identify or establish contact with a specific individual, serves as a cornerstone of modern interactions. This data, pivotal for businesses and governmental entities alike, fuels the provision of goods and services. By processing personal data, valuable insights into user preferences emerge, facilitating customization, targeted advertising, and the refinement of recommendations. Furthermore, this data processing holds relevance for law enforcement purposes. Nevertheless, the unconstrained processing of personal data poses threats to individuals' privacy—a fundamental right—potentially resulting in financial setbacks, harm to reputation, and the development of profiles that may misrepresent individuals .
India's current regulatory landscape lacks a dedicated data protection law. The utilization of personal data falls under the jurisdiction of the Information Technology (IT) Act of 2000. Addressing the need for a comprehensive data protection framework, the Indian government established the Committee of Experts on Data Protection, led by Justice B. N. Srikrishna, in 2017. After meticulous examination, the Committee submitted its report in July 2018, culminating in the formulation of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. The bill underwent scrutiny by a Joint Parliamentary Committee, which issued its findings in December 2021.2 Regrettably, the bill was withdrawn from Parliament in August 2022, while a Draft Bill was released for public input in November of the same year. Subsequently, in August 2023, the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023 was introduced in Parliament, reflecting ongoing efforts to address the critical domain of personal data protection.
5.4 Analysis Of The Bill
•	Exemptions for State processing under the guise of national security may lead to excessive data collection and compromise the right to privacy.
•	The Bill lacks regulations for potential harms arising from personal data processing.
•	Rights such as data portability and the right to be forgotten are absent in the Bill.
•	Transfer of personal data outside India is permitted to authorized nations, potentially lacking comprehensive data protection assessment.
•	Indian Data Protection Board members serve two years with reappointment prospects, possibly affecting the board's independence due to short terms and potential reappointments.
5.4.1 Key Features Of The Bill
•	Application: The scope of the Bill encompasses the management of digital personal data, encompassing data processed within India, sourced either online or offline and subsequently digitized. Even if the processing occurs beyond Indian borders, it falls under the Bill's purview when it's carried out to provide services or products within the country. "Personal data" pertains to information linked to an identifiable individual, while "processing" denotes any automated action involving digitally stored personal data, encompassing its collection, retention, utilization, and dissemination.
•	Consent: Personal data can only be handled with an individual's explicit consent and for lawful purposes. A prior notification is essential before seeking consent, which must encompass details about the personal data to be collected and the intended processing objectives. The individual retains the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Certain "legitimate grounds" exist where consent isn't mandatory, including instances such as when data is voluntarily provided by an individual, government offers services, medical emergencies, or employment contexts. In cases involving minors below 18 years, the consent of a parent or legal guardian is requisite.
•	Rights and obligations of the data principal: The data principal enjoys several rights, including the ability to (i) seek information regarding data processing, (ii) request the correction and erasure of personal data, (iii) appoint a successor in case of incapacitation or demise, and (iv) lodge complaints for resolution. However, certain responsibilities also rest upon data principals, barring them from (i) lodging frivolous complaints, (ii) presenting misleading information, or (iii) assuming someone else's identity under specific conditions. Breaches of these duties are subject to penalties, with fines extending up to Rs 10,000. This symbiotic framework balances rights and responsibilities to ensure a judicious use of data.
•	Data fiduciaries have obligations including: The entity handling data must (i) undertake reasonable measures to verify data accuracy and comprehensiveness; (ii) institute adequate security protocols to forestall data breaches; (iii) promptly alert the Data Protection Board of India and affected individuals in the event of a breach; and (iv) expunge personal data when its intended purpose is fulfilled and retention is no longer legally warranted (section not specified). Worth noting is that government entities enjoy exemptions from storage constraints and the data principal's right to erasure. This framework underscores the dual commitment to data integrity and privacy protection, catering to both efficient data management and individual rights within a comprehensive legislative context.
•	Outside of India: The Bill grants the provision for transferring personal data, contingent upon the exclusion of nations explicitly barred by an official notice from the national government. This regulatory stipulation is enacted to ensure a prudent and selective approach to data transfers, aligning with national interests and security considerations. The mechanism seeks to strike a balance between facilitating international data flows and safeguarding data against unwarranted or unsafe destinations, reinforcing the bill's overarching intent of promoting responsible data management and privacy protection in the digital age.  
•	Exemptions: The Bill encompasses exemptions under specific scenarios where data principal rights and data fiduciary obligations (excluding data security) cease to apply. These include (i) instances of crime prevention and investigation, and (ii) safeguarding legal rights or claims. Furthermore, certain activities can be excluded from the Bill's purview via a central government notice. This encompasses (i) data processing by government agencies for national security and public order objectives, and (ii) information collection for research, archival, or statistical purposes. These exemptions serve to strike a judicious balance between privacy rights, security imperatives, and the broader societal welfare, providing the legislative framework with the flexibility to cater to multifaceted scenarios and ensuring a comprehensive approach to data management and protection.
•	Data Protection Board of India: Under the purview of the national government, the establishment of the Data Protection Board of India is envisaged. The Board assumes pivotal responsibilities, encompassing (i) the imposition of fines for noncompliance, (ii) the mandate to direct data fiduciaries in the event of a data breach, and (iii) the provision for addressing grievances brought forth by affected parties. Board members shall hold office for two years, subject to reappointment possibilities, with the number of members and the selection process stipulated by the national government. Appeals against the Board's decisions will be adjudicated by the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), ensuring an independent and transparent adjudicatory process to oversee the Board's directives and uphold the principles of accountability and fair play.
•	Penalties: The schedule to the Bill outlines fines up to (i) Rs 200 crore for failing to perform commitments to minors and (ii) Rs 250 crore for failing to take security precautions to avoid data breaches for a variety of crimes.  The Board will issue penalties following an investigation.  
5.5 Issues And Challenges Of The Bill
Privacy apprehensions could potentially face repercussions due to exemptions extended to the State in the proposed Bill. The bill encompasses numerous provisions exempting the State's activities involving personal data. According to Article 12 of the Constitution, the State includes (i) the central government, (ii) state governments, (iii) local bodies, and (iv) authorities and entities established by the government. These exclusions, however, could engender certain challenges and complexities. While such exemptions could be predicated on the necessity for public welfare and governance, striking a harmonious balance between safeguarding citizens' privacy rights and enabling effective governance remains a critical consideration in the evolving landscape of data protection legislation .
5.5.1 The Bill May Let The State To Process Data Without Being Reviewed, Which Might Violate Someone's Right To Privacy.
In 2017, the Supreme Court rendered a significant verdict, affirming that any breach of the right to privacy must be in proportion to the justification for such intrusion. However, the proposed Data Protection Bill raises concerns by granting the central government the discretion to exempt government agencies from adhering to regulations, potentially straying from the principle of proportionality. This discretion could lead to excessive data collection, processing, and retention beyond what is genuinely necessary, thus infringing upon individuals' fundamental right to privacy.
The Bill confers upon the central government the power to exempt government agencies from regulatory oversight under specific circumstances, citing public order and state security goals as reasons. Notably, certain rights of data principals and obligations of data fiduciaries may be disregarded, such as in cases involving crime prevention, investigation, and prosecution. Moreover, the Bill lacks a mandate for government entities to erase personal data once the original purpose of processing is fulfilled. This enables government agencies to amass comprehensive profiles of individuals for surveillance, drawing data from various sources, which raises questions about the conformity of such actions with the principle of proportionality .
This stance deviates from established legal precedents, such as the 1996 Supreme Court ruling, which outlined safeguards including the demonstration of need, purpose limitation, and storage limitation for communication interceptions undertaken for national security. These safeguards parallel the responsibilities that data fiduciaries, whose applicability is curtailed by the Bill, are expected to uphold. The Srikrishna Committee's recommendations also advocated a similar approach, proposing that obligations other than fair and reasonable processing and security measures should not be applicable in cases of processing driven by national security or crime prevention and prosecution. This underscores the need for a coherent legal framework to balance the vital imperatives of national security with individuals' privacy rights .
Similar exclusions are provided for national security and defence under the 2018 data privacy law that was passed in the United Kingdom. The Investigatory Powers Act of 2016 regulates operations such as mass processing of personal information for intelligence and law enforcement purposes by government authorities. The Secretary of State (i.e., the Home Minister) issues a warrant authorising such action, which must first be approved by a Judicial Commissioner.  It is necessary to prove the need and proportionality of such activities.  Data retention is limited after the warrant's expiration date.  Also included in this statute is legislative oversight.
5.5.2 Whether It Is Reasonable To Override Consent For Objectives Like Benefits, Subsidies, Licences, And Certificates
The Bill introduces a notable provision concerning the State's processing of personal data to deliver benefits, services, licenses, permissions, or certificates, wherein the necessity for individual consent is superseded. It explicitly permits repurposing data collected for one such purpose for another and extends permission for utilizing pre-existing personal information held by the State for these aims. This effectively negates the principle of purpose limitation, a cornerstone of privacy protection, which dictates that data should only be collected and employed for its original intended purpose. The legitimacy and need for such exclusions are subject to deliberation, as they present a potential departure from conventional privacy safeguards .
Consequently, the possibility of amalgamating data collected for diverse purposes could enable profiling of individuals. However, if consent requirements were upheld, individuals would retain the power to exercise agency and control over the collection and sharing of their personal data. This juxtaposition underscores the nuanced balance between efficient governance practices and safeguarding citizens' privacy rights, with the framework reflecting a strategic choice between facilitating administrative convenience and upholding the foundational tenets of data privacy .
5.5.3 The Bill Does Not Address Damage Brought On By The Handling Of Personal Data.
The risks of damages resulting from the processing of personal data are not regulated by the Bill.  The Srikrishna Committee (2018) has noted that processing personal data might have negative effects. Material losses like monetary loss and loss of access to benefits or services are examples of harm. Identity theft, reputational damage, prejudice, and irrational profiling and surveillance may also be included. It had suggested that data protection laws be used to control damages.
According to the Personal Data Protection Bill of 2019, damage includes (i) physical harm, (ii) psychological harm, (iii) identity theft, (iv) financial loss, (v) reputational loss, (vi) discriminatory treatment, and (vii) observation or monitoring that the data principal could not reasonably have anticipated.  Data fiduciaries were obligated to take action under the 2019 Bill to avoid, reduce, and mitigate risks of damage. These included conducting audits and impact studies to evaluate these risks.  In cases when the data principle has been harmed, it also gave them the right to pursue compensation from the data fiduciary or data processor.  The measures covering harm resulting from the processing of personal data had been recommended for retention by the Joint Parliamentary Committee, which was looking at the 2019 Bill.The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2 governs risks of harm and offers compensation to the data principal in the case of harm.
5.4 No Provision Is Made For The Right To Data Portability Or The Right To Be Forgotten.
Notably absent from the Bill are the rights to data portability and the right to be forgotten, which were encompassed in both the 2019 Bill presented in Parliament and the 2018 Draft Bill. In the assessment of the 2019 Bill, the Joint Parliamentary Committee underscored the importance of retaining these rights, a stance that aligns with the principles enshrined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As emphasized by the Srikrishna Committee's (2018) insights, a robust framework of primary data rights is a pivotal facet of effective data protection legislation, serving as a conduit for empowering individuals to manage their data in alignment with principles of autonomy, transparency, and accountability .
The right to data portability constitutes a pivotal aspect of these primary rights. This right empowers data principals to receive and transfer their data in a structured, machine-readable format from data fiduciaries for their personal usage. This enhances the data principal's control over their own information, facilitating smoother data transitions between different data fiduciaries. However, concerns arise regarding potential exposure of trade secrets held by data fiduciaries. Addressing this, the Srikrishna Committee recommended that the right be implemented while safeguarding trade secrets, disclosing information if feasible without compromising these proprietary elements. The Joint Parliamentary Committee further endorsed that the denial of the right to data portability must hinge on technical feasibility and not be invoked on the grounds of trade secrets.
Additionally, the "right to be forgotten" entails an individual's prerogative to regulate the extent to which their personal information remains accessible online. This right, acknowledged as a crucial measure by the Srikrishna Committee, seeks to establish temporal limitations within the boundless digital sphere. However, this right's exercise necessitates a delicate balance with other rights and interests, as it might intersect with freedom of expression and informational rights of other individuals. Its implementation hinges on considerations like the sensitivity of the data, its public relevance, and the data principal's status in the public domain . 
5.5 Adequate Protection In Cases Of Data Transmission Across Borders
According to the Bill, the federal government may impose a notification-based ban on the transfer of personal data to particular nations.  This indicates that there are no specific limitations on the transfer of personal data to any other nations.  If this method will offer sufficient defence, that is the question.
The overarching objective of regulations governing the cross-border transfer of personal data from India is to safeguard the privacy of Indian citizens. Data stored in jurisdictions with lax data protection laws could be more vulnerable to breaches and illicit sharing, whether with foreign governments or commercial entities. The 2019 Bill outlines that personal data should only be transmitted to countries ensuring an acceptable level of security. Conversely, the 2022 Draft Bill employs an alternate approach wherein the central government notifies countries eligible to receive such data. Both mechanisms entail a case-specific evaluation of regulations in potential recipient nations. However, a comprehensive assessment isn't a prerequisite for the system to impose restrictions on specific countries, thereby ensuring a judicious framework that balances international data flows and data protection imperatives .
5.6 Shorter Appointment Terms Might Affect The Board's Independence.
The Data Protection Board of India, as per the Bill, functions as an autonomous entity. Board members, appointed for a two-year term with potential reappointment, may face constraints in exercising independence due to these short-term arrangements. The Board's core functions encompass overseeing compliance, conducting investigations, and imposing sanctions.
Addressing the issue of tribunal appointments, the Supreme Court (2019) observed that such short-term appointments coupled with reappointment possibilities can potentially augment the Executive's influence and authority. Regulatory bodies with adjudicative roles, such as the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and the Competition Commission of India, operate under five-year terms as prescribed by their respective Acts. Similarly, TRAI holds three-year appointments, while SEBI adheres to five-year tenures as per the established Rules. This juxtaposition highlights the intricate interplay between appointment terms, independence, and regulatory efficacy within the context of diverse regulatory bodies.
5.7 Additional Child-Related Provisions
When handling children's data, additional responsibilities apply.  Below, we go into problems with these clauses.
5.7.1 Various Jurisdictions Have Varied Definitions Of Children.
There are variances in how various countries define a child for the purpose of granting permission for the processing of personal data, notwithstanding the widely acknowledged notion that the processing of a child's data should be subject to higher protection.  A kid has been defined under the Bill as a person who is less than 18 years old.  Persons above the age of 13 in the USA and the UK can agree to the processing of their personal data. This age is specified by the EU's GDPR at 16, although member nations may decrease it as low as 13.  The Srikrishna Committee (2018) has suggested that a number of variables be taken into account when assessing the age of consent for minors. There are two of these: (i) a 13-year-old minimum age and an 18-year-old maximum age; and (ii) a single threshold to ensure practical application. Additionally, it was noted that 18 years may be too old from the standpoint of a child's complete autonomous development. The age of consent should be set at 18, nevertheless, to be consistent with the current legal system. The Indian Contract Act of 1872 stipulates that a person must be 18 years old to execute a contract .
5.7.2 VERIFYING EVERYONE'S AGE ON DIGITAL PLATFORMS MAY BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN VERIFIED PARENTAL PERMISSION.
The Bill mandates that before processing a child's personal information, data fiduciaries must first seek verified consent from the child's legal guardian.  Every data fiduciary will need to confirm the age of each person registering for its services in order to abide by this requirement.  In order to get the approval of the person's legal guardian, it will be necessary to ascertain if the subject is a kid.  This could make it less likely for kids to make misleading declarations.  However, this can make it harder to remain anonymous online .
5.7.3 Unclear Definition Of What Is Harmful To A Child's Wellbeing
According to the Bill, data fiduciaries are not allowed to treat data in a way that might be harmful to a child's wellbeing.   The term "harmful effect" is not defined in the Bill.  Additionally, it hasn't offered any guidelines for figuring out this effect.  
5.7.4 There May Not Be A Need For An Exception From The Consent Notice.
According to the Bill, the federal government has the authority to release some data fiduciaries, or classes of data fiduciaries, including startups, from certain requirements.  The quantity and kind of personal data must be taken into consideration when doing this.  Notice for consent is one of the responsibilities that may be excused.  In the case of these entities, the duty to obtain free and informed permission will still be in effect.  However, it might be claimed that a data principal will not be able to give informed consent if there is no requirement to provide notice regarding the nature of the data gathered and the purpose of processing.
5.8 Drafting Problem
Although Clause 36 does not contain any sub-sections, Clause 27 (1) (e) refers to Clause 36's sub-section (2) .

 
CHAPTER 6: JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF RIGHT TO PRIVACY
In the precedent-setting case of M.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra , the Indian Supreme Court deliberated on the legal conundrum surrounding the 'power of search and seizure'. Here, the Court opined that privacy couldn't be assimilated into the ambit of fundamental rights, asserting its detachment from the contours of the Indian Constitution. Evidently, the Court's scrutiny appeared constrained, centering exclusively on the legislative imperative. However, a decade hence, another consequential legal episode emerged, focusing its lens on the intricate sphere of surveillance.
In the landmark case of Kharak Singh v. The State of Uttar Pradesh , pivotal questions emerged surrounding the ramifications of surveillance as defined by Regulation 236 of the Uttar Pradesh Police Regulation. This case critically examined whether such surveillance encroached upon fundamental rights and whether the right to privacy held the status of a fundamental right. Ultimately, the Court ruled in favor of Kharak Singh, asserting that the right to privacy wasn't inherently enshrined as a fundamental right under our Constitution. Consequently, the act of surveilling an individual's movements in a manner infringing upon their privacy didn't transgress a fundamental right protected by Part III of the Indian Constitution. Despite this determination, the Court identified Article 21—the right to life—as the repository for residual personal rights and recognized the common law concept of privacy. However, it was Justice Subba Rao who notably articulated that the right to privacy is an intrinsic facet of individual liberty. 
In the case of Govind v. State of M.P.,  although bearing resemblance to the Kharak Singh case, a markedly distinct approach was undertaken. While upholding the constitutionality of the Madhya Pradesh Police Regulation Act of 1961, certain constraints were imposed. The Indian judiciary's perspective was that the right to privacy indeed exists, safeguarded within the precincts of Part III of the Indian Constitution. However, the Supreme Court also underscored that, in the absence of legislative enactment, the right to privacy must necessarily undergo an incremental process termed "case-by-case development." This approach acknowledges that a solitary case cannot comprehensively unravel the nuances and exemptions of the right to privacy. Evidently, this ruling undeniably expanded the scope of Article 21, encompassing the right to privacy under its protective umbrella, while recognizing the imperative for gradual jurisprudential evolution. 
In the notable case of ADM Jabalpur v. Shivakant Shukla,  the Supreme Court sought to discern whether the right to personal liberty is circumscribed solely by constitutional and statutory limitations. This landmark ruling underscores that while the right to privacy might not be explicitly enshrined, its implicit presence within common law can't be dismissed. Moreover, the case firmly establishes that personal liberty remains unimpeded by restrictions beyond those prescribed by the Constitution and statutory enactments. Justice Khanna's discerning observation further elucidates this stance: "Article 21 is not the sole repository of the right to personal liberty. No one shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty without the authority of laws follows not merely from common law, it flows equally from statutory law like the penal law that is in force in India." This articulation reaffirms that the protection of personal liberty is firmly rooted not only in common law but also in the legislative framework, ensuring its comprehensive safeguarding.
The pivotal case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India  marked a turning point, wherein the Indian Supreme Court presented an expansive construal of Article 21. Through this case, Article 21 of the Indian Constitution was effectively imbued with the notion of 'natural law,' as articulated by the Court. This 'natural law' encapsulates the vital rights to personal liberty and personal security. The pronounced impact of this case lay in its establishment of a broadened interpretation of the Fundamental Right termed the Right to Life, which consequently facilitated the inclusion of the right to privacy within the ambit of this fundamental guarantee. In effect, Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India not only solidified a more comprehensive perspective of Article 21 but also underscored its instrumental role in encompassing the right to privacy under the overarching safeguard of the Right to Life. This landmark decision fortified the nexus between personal liberty, privacy, and the foundational rights upheld by the Indian Constitution.
The pivotal case of R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu  stands as an early milestone in the intricate evolution of an individual's constitutionally safeguarded right to privacy. The highest echelon of the judiciary meticulously determined that the right to personal privacy is intrinsically intertwined with the sacrosanct right to life and liberty, as sanctified under Article 21 of the Constitution. Moreover, the case astutely recognized the unassailable entitlement of every citizen to shield the confidentiality of not only their personal matters but also those of their family, encompassing domains like marriage, procreation, motherhood, childbearing, and education. The verdict resolutely emphasized that dissemination of information touching upon these domains necessitates prior consent, reserving the right to privacy as both a justiciable claim and an elemental right simultaneously. R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu thus laid the cornerstone for a nuanced legal framework, anchoring the right to privacy within the broader framework of fundamental rights and affirming its multifaceted implications for individual dignity and autonomy.
The case of People's Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India  marked a pivotal juncture wherein the contours of the right to privacy underwent a notable expansion to encompass communications. Central to this case was the debate surrounding the intrusion into an individual's private realm through phone tapping and whether such intrusion infringes upon their right to privacy as enshrined under Article 21. The judiciary not only delved into the constitutionality of such actions but also laid down regulatory benchmarks for interception within the legislative landscape. This included stipulations that only the home secretary could issue such orders, consideration of the necessity of information, and more. Furthermore, the ruling extended the maximum duration of an intercepting order by an additional two months. Additionally, the Supreme Court underscored that the assertion of an individual's right to privacy and the determination of its violation in a specific case would hinge on the factual circumstances unique to that case. People's Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India thus marked a significant stride in the adjudication of privacy rights in the context of evolving communication technologies. 
The case of District Registrar and Collector, Hyderabad and another v. Canara Bank and another (2004)  stands as yet another instance where the verdict of the Supreme Court lucidly delineated the foundational underpinnings of the right to privacy. This ruling astutely highlighted that the bedrock of personal liberty, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement forms the gateway to the right to privacy. It elucidated that the right to privacy is intricately linked with the sphere of individuals' autonomy. The Court further elucidated that any encroachment upon this personal realm could only be sanctioned through legislative provisions, administrative or executive decisions, or by the imprimatur of a court order. Emphasizing the paramountcy of individual privacy, the Court emphasized its intimate association with personal dignity and self-determination. This judgment thus accentuated the imperative to safeguard the sanctity of private spheres, setting a notable precedent for the legal protection of privacy rights in India. 
The case of Selvi and others v. The State of Karnataka  and others bore profound legal implications, elucidating a nuanced distinction between the physical and mental dimensions of privacy while establishing a pivotal connection between the right to privacy and the constitutional provision of Article 20(3) pertaining to self-incrimination. The Supreme Court astutely recognized the need to differentiate between an individual's entitlement to bodily privacy and their right to safeguard their mental health. Although criminal law and evidence regulations might, in certain circumstances, sanction invasions into physical privacy, they can't be wielded to compel a person to disclose personal knowledge about a pertinent fact. The ruling also unveiled a significant nexus between the right to privacy and Article 20(3), wherein the act of making a statement was elucidated as an exercise of an individual's private volition. Consequently, another person's authority to infringe upon this prerogative was unequivocally negated. This landmark judgment demarcated the boundaries of mental privacy, holding that subjecting an individual to investigative techniques like narcoanalysis, polygraph tests, or Brain Electrical Activation Profile (BEAP) tests without their informed consent could indeed be deemed a violation of their right to mental privacy, fundamentally safeguarding individual autonomy and integrity. 
In the case of Unique Identification Authority of India and others v. Central Bureau of Investigation, a significant legal issue arose surrounding the Central Bureau of Investigation's requisition to access an extensive database compiled by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) for criminal investigations. The UIDAI was the entity responsible for curating this database. The Supreme Court's verdict pronounced that the UIDAI is expressly barred from disclosing an individual's biometric data to any external party, including organizations, once the person has been issued an Aadhaar card, unless explicit written consent has been obtained from that individual. Furthermore, the Court held that no person should be deprived of any form of service due to the absence of an Aadhaar number, as long as the individual is otherwise eligible or entitled to receive such services. The Court's interim ruling necessitates prompt revisions in the circulars, forms, and related documents by various authorities to eliminate the mandatory requirement of an Aadhaar number, ensuring compliance with the Court's directives. This landmark decision reinforces the principles of individual consent and equitable access to services while reaffirming the careful balance between privacy protection and legitimate investigatory needs.
The pivotal case of Justice K.S. Puttuswamy (Retired) and Others v. Union of India and Others  stemmed from a petition challenging the constitutional validity of India's Aadhaar biometric identity program, intertwining the contours of the program with the right to privacy discourse. At its heart lay the question of whether fundamental rights, including the right to privacy, found protection within the constitutional fabric. Contrarily, the Attorney General of India posited that the populace of India wasn't inherently endowed with the right to privacy as a fundamental right. Ultimately, the Supreme Court arrived at a verdict deferring the pivotal issue of the right to privacy to a larger constitutional bench for comprehensive deliberation. This course was dictated by the existence of conflicting judgments—some doubting the presence of the right to privacy and others acknowledging it as a fundamental right—rendered by benches larger than the ones recognizing the right. This entangled the Court in an irresolvable dilemma, compelling the matter to be elevated to a higher bench for resolution. The subsequent unanimous decision handed down by the Supreme Court in the case of Justice K.S. Puttuswamy (Ret.) v. Union of India  marked a resounding victory for privacy, underscoring its growing significance and warranting an earnest reexamination of its tenets within the broader constitutional framework. 
A pivotal juncture in the evolution of India's constitutional jurisprudence transpired when the judiciary unambiguously enshrined the right to personal privacy as an inherent human entitlement. This watershed moment emerged through a unanimous order, endorsed by all nine justices, articulating that "The right to privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution." On the momentous date of August 24, 2017, the Supreme Court of India issued a landmark pronouncement, solidifying the right to privacy as an essential shield fortified by the Indian Constitution. This landmark declaration bore significance akin to the Supreme Court of the United States' assertion that the bedrock of individual rights, encompassing life and liberty, extends organically to encompass privacy—a dictum with far-reaching ramifications. The case of Puttuswamy v. Union of India  underwent rigorous examination by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court. This august panel delineated the contours of the right to privacy within the embrace of Part III of the Constitution. The pronouncement was a response to a reference made in relation to the legal challenge against India's endeavor to establish the Aadhaar national identity program. The Advocate General of India contended that the Fundamental Right to privacy wasn't enshrined within the Indian Constitution. This stance was premised upon two precedent cases: the M.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra , adjudicated by an eight-judge bench in 1954, and the Kharak Singh v. State of U.P, decided by a six-judge bench in 1962—both pronouncing the absence of a fundamental right to privacy. Strikingly, over 55 years have elapsed since these rulings, and no larger bench has convened to review these matters, largely owing to the absence of exigency post these cases. The prevailing omission of the right to privacy from the domain of Fundamental Rights clarifies the continued legal enforceability of these earlier verdicts, anchoring them in the legal discourse. Thus, this landmark verdict—reverberating with historical significance—reiterated the indivisible nature of privacy from life and personal liberty, charting an indelible course in India's constitutional trajectory.
In the momentous case of Justice K.S. Puttuswamy (Retd.) & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors, a Nine-Judge bench of the Supreme Court was entrusted with the monumental task of definitively establishing the contours of the right to privacy. Marked by the nomenclature Justice K.S. Puttuswamy (Retd.) & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors,  this case consequently triggered a profound shift in India's legal landscape. This transformative judgment, spanning an extensive 547 pages, conclusively overruled prior decisions that had denied the status of the right to privacy as a fundamental facet of Fundamental Rights. Crucially, the unanimous pronouncement by all nine justices underscored the integral nature of the right to privacy within the edifice of Fundamental Rights. The ruling aptly elucidated that this right need not be construed in isolation but rather in the context of Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Indian Constitution. This profound recognition highlighted the inalienable nature of this right, serving as a bulwark shielding individuals from state actions that might encroach upon their privacy, thereby subjecting such actions to rigorous Judicial Review. Simultaneously, the judgment underscored the balanced character of the right by stipulating its susceptibility to reasonable restrictions. This pivotal nuance emphasized that the right to privacy isn't boundless, and its assertion may be tempered by the state's legitimate interest in upholding societal order. Nonetheless, this determination was buttressed by the application of specific criteria, exemplified by the following three tests: 
i.	There needs to be a legislation that is reasonable and that would look into the invasion on private. 
ii.	To ensure that a valid state objective or requirement, as well as the content of this legislation, will fall within the margin of reasonable limitation and that it will function to guard against arbitrary action on the part of the state. 
iii.	The adoption of measures by the state is in conformity to the requirements and objectives, which have to be met in order for the law to be upheld. The preceding ruling rendered by the court carries with it a number of additional repercussions, in addition to those already mentioned. 
Therefore, despite the fact that there are a number of intricacies involved, the Supreme Court has placed an emphasis on the requirement of enacting laws on the right to privacy that is going to be of a character that is comprehensive. It was also mentioned that the government had previously established a committee with Retired Justice B.N. Srikrishna serving as the Chairman, and they had instructed that group to investigate the many different problems that are associated with the right to one's privacy. In July of 2017, a committee that would later be known as the Justice B. N. Srikrishna Committee was constituted with the aim of deliberating the data protection framework. This would, in turn, make it possible for the government to move forward with the development of new data protection legislation for the country. The report that was put together by this committee underlined that it is necessary to defend the interests of the public and the duty of the state, but that this cannot be done at the expense of business and commerce. 
Moreover, the Committee undertook the formulation of a bill aimed at safeguarding personally identifiable information. Within the legal framework of India, the Right to Privacy stands protected by Article 21 of the Constitution, which asserts it as an inherent aspect of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty. Furthermore, Part III of the Indian Constitution encompasses the Right to Freedom, a comprehensive purview that includes the Right to Privacy. Notably, this judicial interpretation has endowed India with a robust model for upholding fundamental rights, exemplified by the right to privacy and the freedom of speech.

Reflecting on the evolutionary trajectory of the right to privacy, a culmination emerges wherein extensive judicial elucidation, spanning multiple instances, underscores its definitive integration into Part III of the Indian Constitution. The pivotal importance of the right to privacy in preserving human dignity is palpable, substantiating its explicit inclusion in the Preamble of the Constitution, affirming this right for every individual within the nation's ambit. Beyond merely serving as a buffer against state intrusion, the right to privacy empowers the state to foster institutions that safeguard individuals' private spheres. Recognizing the symbiotic relationship between the right to privacy and freedom of speech, particularly in an era characterized by rapid digitization, amplifies the significance of this fundamental right. The far-reaching implications of these judicial pronouncements in privacy protection are poised to reverberate through India's legal landscape, solidifying the right to privacy as an indispensable facet of the Fundamental Rights granted to the nation's populace.
 
CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION & SUGGESTIONS
The internet has significantly sped up the expansion of e-Commerce at a time of digital globalisation. Personal data transfer both domestically and internationally has skyrocketed. Only the internet has been able to support this expansion. The art of modern technology has been influenced by the internet. People were interested in business even in the ancient civilization, but today, e-business is the form of trade in which our culture is most actively involved. The distinction between the two is that in the former, commerce required actual physical contact between individuals. 
From the earliest stages of bartering to the contemporary digital trade, the evolution of commerce has followed an intricate path. In antiquity, trade was conducted in its most rudimentary form – physical exchanges necessitating the presence of both parties. Subsequently, the rise of banking marked a shift toward more advanced forms of commerce, where transactions occurred between banks and individuals, and the concept of currency gradually replaced bartering. Yet, it was the rapid expansion of the internet that paved the way for a revolutionary phase known as "e-Commerce," redefining the very fabric of business practices.
While the term "commerce" universally encapsulates the exchange of goods and services, the narrative of e-Commerce is deeply intertwined with the history of information technology. The metamorphosis of commerce can be attributed to technological breakthroughs that have fundamentally altered the landscape of trade. Unlike the traditional mode of in-person interactions, the paradigm of e-Commerce enables transactions to unfold virtually, with individuals engaging digitally in buying and selling activities. The omnipresence of online platforms has rendered geographical boundaries irrelevant, enabling buyers and sellers to operate seamlessly across distances. This transformative shift is ascribed to the development of information and communication technology (ICT) and the advent of the World Wide Web (WWW), collectively propelling e-Commerce into prominence. Within this overarching framework, four prevailing e-Commerce models - Business-to-Consumer (B2C), Business-to-Business (B2B), Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C), and Consumer-to-Business (C2B) - encompass the multifaceted facets of modern commercial interactions.
These innovative business models save time and money. Online commerce includes all forms of purchasing and selling. It does not necessitate face-to-face contact between the persons involved. The most intriguing aspect of e-commerce is that it allows individuals to do business from anywhere at any time, and that it allows consumers to get information about the desired items through web sites. Another channel that makes it easier for customers to access services is email. Despite the benefits that the internet and technology have brought to human civilization, those who value privacy and data security cannot ignore the flaws they include. Scholars consider the internet to be an unsafe medium, and They are correct; it is a risky medium since we have no idea with whom we are transacting business and the identities of those participating are hidden. 
There are internet intermediates, sometimes referred to as "middle men," that enable the services, although their culpability in situations involving legal and technological concerns is constrained. Therefore, in situations when intermediaries are protected by the law, who will be held accountable? In comparison to citizens of the European Union and the United Kingdom, Indian society is less involved and aware of its rights around privacy and data protection. Not only are the people in these two nations aware, but the government is also more active and goal-oriented when it comes to privacy and data protection. 
In India, a lack of awareness among consumers and a dearth of awareness-raising initiatives have given rise to concerns over privacy, data protection, and various legal and regulatory challenges. The convergence of insufficient legal frameworks for privacy and data protection, coupled with consumers' limited understanding, underscores the need for comprehensive legislation in this sphere. The quest for privacy, while universally recognized as a fundamental human right, presents complexities in its enforcement due to the absence of a uniform definition. The concept of privacy remains fluid, varying across individuals and even among different countries . 
The emergence of technology has compromised people's right to privacy and data protection. Every individual has a right to create boundaries and protect their privacy against invasion by other people and, in certain cases, the government as well. The word "privacy" cannot be properly defined in a single way. Different aspects of privacy exist. Technology advancements, uncontrollable internet platforms, and an infinite scope of jurisdiction opened the door to unstoppable cybercrimes that are challenging to combat in the absence of appropriate legislation . 
The emergence of the Data Protection Bill and the Consumer Protection Bill in 2018 has introduced a renewed perspective, yet the full clarity sought by our populace and regulatory bodies remains elusive. The pervasive influence of technology, which poses a formidable threat to consumer data and privacy, has underscored the inadequacy of our current regulations. Consumers find themselves ensnared in the intricate web of internet transactions, occurring ubiquitously and propelled by ceaseless technological advancements. In this milieu, safeguarding privacy and data becomes an intricate challenge, compounded by the absence of comprehensive governing principles. The transnational nature of data transfers, often transpiring without the informed consent of data subjects, further exacerbates the issue. The existing legal frameworks, inadequate in addressing the legal complexities inherent computer and internet usage, falter in effectively resolving these intricate challenges.
Protection of personal data emerges as yet another multifaceted legal concern. Engaging in online activities without due vigilance can precipitate the inadvertent relinquishment of data ownership. Within the swiftly expanding domain of internet commerce, India encounters a glaring void in terms of a robust legal framework capable of comprehensively addressing the intricate panorama of privacy and data-related matters. As the contours of e-Commerce evolve and technology advances with unceasing momentum, the imperative to establish a responsive legal framework becomes even more pronounced, aimed at protecting the interests and rights of consumers in this digitally driven era.
The increased use of the internet for various reasons exposes user data, and personal information that enters India through transborder movement is not at all protected. To monitor all incoming and outgoing data, India requires regulations similar to those of the OECD (Transborder Flows of Personal Data 1980). The internet world now demands that India pass laws protecting personal information and privacy online. Every person has various values when it comes to their privacy. The yearning for seclusion from other people's influence is the sole thing that unites all individuals. This right must be upheld since it is inalienable and applies to both the real and digital worlds. The right to privacy and the freedom of expression (Article 19) are viewed as complementary rights and are frequently interpreted as such. 
The three categories serve as the key divisions of this study's goal. The first was to research the concerns about privacy and data protection in Indian eCommerce, as well as to critically evaluate the gaps in the country's present e-commerce regulations and look into any necessary revisions. In chapters one and three of the thesis, this goal has been attempted to be accomplished. A survey of the literature by many authors on the subject of data protection and privacy revealed that the emergence of the internet was largely responsible for these concerns. Before the internet and technology took off There were no such problems because they were only accessible to humans and were well secured. Since human lives are always changing, the idea of privacy and data protection has also developed through time. 
The borderless expanse of the internet has brought forth a complex conundrum encompassing privacy and data protection. A comprehensive exploration unfolded on several fronts, with distinct goals, each tackling an intricate facet of this intricate challenge. Firstly, attention was directed towards deciphering the obscurities encircling the imposition of intermediaries' liability in instances involving privacy and data protection within the realms of both domestic and international e-commerce in India. Notably, the Information Technology Act of 2000, while bereft of a precise definition of privacy, primarily levies penalties for infringements. This legislative landscape presents a gray area concerning data privacy protection, further underscored by the limited accountability of service providers in India. Delving into the techno-legal sphere, the second goal scrutinized cookie-based activity tracking, data mining, security vulnerabilities, and disruptions in login procedures in e-commerce settings, aiming to identify potential remedies. As this endeavor unfolded, it became evident that India grapples with the absence of apt regulations addressing these issues, leaving consumer privacy and data security compromised in the absence of a legal framework capable of swift and decisive action.
The intricacies of consent, particularly concerning social networking platforms, emerge as another pressing challenge. Lacking the fundamental tenets of consent, these platforms fail to empower users to withhold information they deem personal, and the Indian Government's regulatory oversight remains lax in mandating stringent constraints on these platforms that amass sensitive data. The crux of the issue rests in the absence of comprehensive protocols governing data security and privacy, particularly as information traverses third-party domains without the prior sanction or awareness of the data subject, opening avenues for commercial exploitation. Another formidable concern is data mining, wherein copious volumes of data traverse international borders or diverse jurisdictions sans any discernible identification of individuals, single legal framework, or judicial authority capable of rectifying violations of data subjects' rights.
Guided by the premise that prevailing e-commerce regulations are ill-equipped to address the intricate interplay of legal and technological dimensions concerning privacy and data protection, the research further scrutinized the aspect of service providers' responsibility in safeguarding customer data. Dissecting Indian statutes and meticulously analyzing the panorama of privacy and data protection within the e-commerce milieu underscored the insufficiency of existing legal constructs. Consequently, both conjectures were substantiated, elucidating the inadequacy of current e-commerce legislation and the imperative to fortify data protection and privacy measures within the digital ecosystem .
7.1 Suggestions:
After carefully reading through and making an honest attempt to comprehend the existing research works on the subject of privacy and data, particularly in the context of e-Commerce, it now seems politically right to claim that India is legally crippled and has bowed to the might of technology. The outdated regulations, coupled with the more recent ones that were created particularly to handle e-Commerce-related concerns, utterly fail to keep pace with the technology's growing threat. The insightful recommendations are anticipated to act as a lighthouse for legislators in helping them comprehend the current conditions and the significant damages the internet causes to our daily privacy, personal space, and sensitive personal data. The proposals that I believe are necessary at this time, given the harm done to our privacy and data, are listed below.
•	Amendments in the Information Technology Act, 2008:
The Information Technology Act of 2000 was created to strengthen India's e-Commerce legislation and to legalise electronic contracts and digital signatures. This Act was revised multiple times after failing to achieve its goals in a number of areas; the most recent was in 2008. The relevance of including a legal definition of the terms "privacy" and "data privacy" in the Act was not appreciated by the legislators. The idea that "there is no uniform definition of the term privacy" and that "the internet is invading people's private space and misusing their data without their knowledge or consent" has been the subject of controversy for many decades. Absence of any rules defining these terms in such a situation would be equivalent to choosing to become deaf and dumb. According to me, the current Information Technology Act has to be amended to include these two concepts, namely privacy and data privacy, as well as a definition of what sensitive personal data .
•	A comprehensive privacy and data Law:
Despite the presence of legislative instruments such as the Indian Information Technology Act of 2008, the Indian Penal Code of 1860 (IPC), the Indian Evidence Act, the Indian Contract Act, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Consumer Protection Act, as well as guidelines from SEBI and R.B.I., these legal frameworks collectively or even in a consolidated form fail to comprehensively address the intricacies of privacy and data protection in e-commerce. The existing regulations suffer from inconsistency, rendering them inadequate in confronting the nuanced challenges posed by privacy and data concerns. The dynamic nature of the internet juxtaposed against the static nature of these legal statutes amplifies the inefficacy, particularly given the transnational nature of e-commerce transactions. The involvement of stakeholders from diverse jurisdictions accentuates these issues. In an internet-driven landscape devoid of geographical constraints, the application of jurisdictional laws extends across global customers and courts. Pertinent considerations encompass the choice of law, forum, and jurisdiction in cross-border transactions. Intricacies arise in determining the applicability of laws to involved parties and the binding nature of court decisions. The urgency to redress these concerns is paramount. The imminent requirement for a robust privacy and data protection legislation tailored to e-commerce transactions necessitates a comprehensive articulation of privacy and data privacy while adroitly tackling the intricacies intrinsic to this domain. In the absence of proactive legislative measures to define, delineate, and address these challenges, the persisting issue of privacy and data protection remains an unequivocal imperative.
•	A Uniform Cyber Law for e-Commerce:
The imperative for a cohesive cyber law becomes evident in the domain of e-commerce, primarily to address the paramount concerns surrounding privacy and data protection that affect all stakeholders. This urgency stems from the intrinsic reliance of e-commerce on internet infrastructure, a borderless realm that encompasses global participants. In this intricate milieu, the challenges arising between individuals from divergent jurisdictions necessitate a harmonized legal framework to foster equitable resolution without infringing upon the sovereignty of individual nations' laws. Collaborative efforts among nations engaged in this digital ecosystem are requisite to establish a uniform legislation that can aptly regulate e-commerce activities. Given the intricate web of cross-border transactions and the distinct legal systems governing the various parties, the proposition of applying the legal standards of a singular nation to all participants proves untenable. The ensuing complexity of resolving disputes mandates the establishment of an overarching, standardized cyber law tailored to the intricacies of e-commerce. In doing so, the path to streamlined adjudication is paved, engendering a framework that respects both the interconnectedness of global commerce and the sovereignty of each participating nation.
•	Defining the term ‘e-Commerce’ & ‘e-Consumers’:
The Consumer Protection Act of 1986 and the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 are two consumer-related laws that exist in India. None of the aforementioned Acts define "eCommerce" or "e-Consumers." As a result, I would recommend amending the previous Act to include these phrases for greater comprehension and clarity.
•	Amendment in the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011:
Intermediaries actively participate in the internet environment. These intermediaries play a crucial role in e-Commerce. Although there are norms for intermediaries in India, they are insufficient to address the international problems with data protection and privacy in e-commerce. In accordance with these rules, intermediaries are exempt from liability provided they can show that they were not careless in performing their duties. Customers are the only ones who will be harmed in such a situation. Government should provide standards for intermediaries that are thorough enough to handle the main problems concerning customers in eCommerce transactions both locally and nationally.
•	Laws on transborder flow of data:
With the use of the internet, data may be transported quickly from one jurisdiction to another. These data may include sensitive and personal information including account information, personal preferences, and health-related information. Without a legislation to control data transfers from one jurisdiction to another, there would be confusion and the data would be lost. In the current internet era, sharing personal information is quite frequent in order to access online services, and if particular personal information is withheld, access to such services may be prohibited. Every service offered by an online platform should include a "consent option" and brief information on the security measures taken by the service providers to protect customer data.
•	Separate Online privacy law for children:
In order to safeguard the privacy of minors utilizing online platforms such as Facebook, the Indian government should proactively formulate a dedicated Online Privacy Law. Similar to the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998, this legislation should aim to effectively regulate the collection and transfer of their personal information, offering vital protection within the digital world.
•	Sensitization Programmes at Schools, Rural areas as well as in Urban areas:
The two most important problems in e-Commerce today are invasions of privacy and abuse of personal data. Technology and the internet have become an essential element of daily life. This technology has impacted the lives of individuals of all ages. Without realising the harm being done to our data and privacy, every social stratum is taking full use of the services provided by the internet. People have so completely given in to the simple lifestyles that these technologies provide that they have unintentionally encouraged the negative aspects of the internet. Since the advent of social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, cyber-related crimes have multiplied, and students and young people are the most often targeted demographic. 
Another issue that needs the government's and parents' attention is the general lack of awareness about cybercrimes. In the era of the internet, it is crucial that schools implement a curriculum to raise awareness of cyber-related crimes, privacy concerns, and data security. The active participation of both parents should be included in such a programme of social awareness because parents are the best people to teach their children about the advantages and disadvantages of social networking sites in a relaxed setting at home. People of all ages use the internet to shop in both urban and rural places. Emails and social networking sites like Facebook are also widely used. 
People have fallen prey to the threat posed by this technology participation in our lives due to a lack of understanding as well as awareness about privacy and data protection problems, and they continue to do so. One of the finest uses of e-Commerce made possible by the internet is online shopping. These online retailers are utilising the customers' personal information without their knowledge or permission in order to make money. The worst thing is that most individuals are unaware of and perhaps unconcerned whether their personal information and data is being utilised improperly by outside parties. 
Additionally, there are problems like Facebook's profiling of images. Because many social networking sites lack security, anyone from anywhere may set up a false account, upload a profile image of someone else, and deceive users for unethical purposes . Another milestone is learning how to spot these fraudulent individuals and to stop them from creating false profiles. The best course of action is to first set up a sensitization programme in the aforementioned areas on subjects like cybercrimes, cyberlaws, the value of privacy and data protection, a redress forum for any issues raised above, and other crucial topics that need to be discussed.
