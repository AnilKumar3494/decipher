ABSTRACT
In August 2018, Kerala, an Indian state, experienced devastating floods due to prolonged and intense rainfall. The floods, caused by a combination of a low-pressure system and subsequent monsoon depression, tragically claimed the lives of more than 400 people and left one million displaced. To better understand the reasons behind this calamity, this study reveals critical insights into flood management. The simulations indicated that the six major reservoirs serving the state would have required a 34% increase in capacity to handle the heavy rainfall. Furthermore, had the deluge been amplified by an RCP8.5 climate scenario, this capacity would have needed to rise by 43%. Such findings highlight the importance of strategic planning for flood control and water storage systems to prevent such catastrophes. The consequences of the floods were heart-wrenching. Families not only lost their loved ones but also endured the destruction of their homes, along with cherished belongings such as jewellery, family photographs, and religious artifacts. Tragic as it was, proper flood management could have averted this catastrophe, underscoring the urgent need for robust economic and institutional measures in flood preparedness and response. In conclusion, the 2018 Kerala floods serve as a stark reminder of the significance of assessing both financial and institutional dimensions in flood management. By incorporating advanced modelling techniques and developing effective strategies, we can endeavour to mitigate the impact of such disasters and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of millions.
